This appendix neither creates additional obligations nor detracts from obligations otherwise contained in the standard. It is intended to provide explanatory information and educational material to employers and employees to foster understanding of, and compliance with, the standard.\n\n_Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16_. These standards are minimum safety standards for entering and working safely in vessel tanks and compartments.\n\n_Section 1915.11(b) Definition of \"Hot work.\"_ There are several instances in which circumstances do not necessitate that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting be regarded as hot work. Some examples are:\n\n1\\. Abrasive blasting of the external surface of the vessel (the hull) for paint preparation does not necessitate pumping and cleaning the tanks of the vessel.\n\n2\\. Prior to hot work on any hollow structure, the void space should be tested and appropriate precautions taken.\n\n_Section 1915.11(b) Definition of \"Lower explosive limit.\"_ The terms lower flammable limit (LFL) and lower explosive limit (LEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.\n\n_Section 1915.11(b) Definition of \"Upper explosive limit.\"_ The terms upper flammable limit (UFL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.\n\n_Section 1915.12(a)(3)_. After a tank has been properly washed and ventilated, the tank should contain 20.8 percent oxygen by volume. This is the same amount found in our normal atmosphere at sea level. However, it is possible that the oxygen content will be lower. When this is the case, the reasons for this deficiency should be determined and corrective action taken.\n\nAn oxygen content of 19.5 percent can support life and is adequate for entry. However, any oxygen level greater than 20.8 percent by volume should alert the competent person to look for the cause of the oxygen-enriched atmosphere and correct it prior to entry. In addition, any oxygen level lower than 19.5 percent level should also alert the competent person to look for the cause of the oxygen-deficiency and correct it prior to entry.\n\n_Section 1915.12(b)(3) Flammable atmospheres_. Atmospheres with a concentration of flammable vapors at or above 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) are considered hazardous when located in confined spaces. However, atmospheres with flammable vapors below 10 percent of the LEL are not necessarily safe.\n\nSuch atmospheres are too lean to burn. Nevertheless, when a space contains or produces measurable flammable vapors below the 10 percent LEL, it might indicate that flammable vapors are being released or introduced into the space and could present a hazard in time. Therefore, the cause of the vapors should be investigated and, if possible, eliminated prior to entry.\n\nSome situations that have produced measurable concentrations of flammable vapors that could exceed 10 percent of the LEL in time are:\n\n1\\. Pipelines that should have been blanked or disconnected have opened, allowing product into the space.\n\n2\\. The vessel may have shifted, allowing product not previously cleaned and removed during washing to move into other areas of the vessel.\n\n3\\. Residues may be producing the atmosphere by releasing flammable vapor.\n\n_Section 1915.12(b)(6) Flammable atmospheres that are toxic_. An atmosphere with a measurable concentration of a flammable substance below 10 percent of the LEL may be above the OSHA permissible exposure limit for that substance. In that case, refer to § 1915.12(c) (2), (3), and (4).\n\n_Sections 1915.13(b)(4), 1915.15(c), and 1915.15(e)_. The frequency with which a tank is monitored to determine if atmospheric conditions are being maintained is a function of several factors that are discussed below:\n\n1\\. _Temperature_. Higher temperatures will cause a combustible or flammable liquid to vaporize at a faster rate than lower temperatures. This is important since hotter days may cause tank residues to produce more vapors and that may result in the vapors exceeding 10 percent of the LEL or an overexposure to toxic contaminants.\n\n2\\. _Work in the tank_. Any activity in the tank could change the atmospheric conditions in that tank. Oxygen from a leaking oxyfuel hose or torch could result in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere that would more easily propagate a flame. Some welding operations use inert gas, and leaks can result in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Manual tank cleaning with high pressure spray devices can stir up residues and result in exposures to toxic contaminants. Simple cleaning or mucking out, where employees walk through and shovel residues and sludge, can create a change in atmospheric conditions.\n\n3\\. _Period of time elapsed_. If a period of time has elapsed since a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person has certified a tank as safe, the atmospheric condition should be rechecked by the competent person prior to entry and starting work.\n\n4\\. _Unattended tanks or spaces_. When a tank or space has been tested and declared safe, then subsequently left unattended for a period of time, it should be retested prior to entry and starting work. For example, when barges are left unattended at night, unidentified products from another barge are sometimes dumped into their empty tanks. Since this would result in a changed atmosphere, the tanks should be retested prior to entry and starting work.\n\n5\\. _Work break_. When workers take a break or leave at the end of the shift, equipment sometimes is inadvertently left in the tanks. At lunch or work breaks and at the end of the shift are the times when it is most likely someone will leave a burning or cutting torch in the tank, perhaps turned on and leaking oxygen or an inert gas. Since the former can produce an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, and the latter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, tanks should be checked for equipment left behind, and atmosphere, monitored if necessary prior to re-entering and resuming work. In an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, the flammable range is severely broadened. This means that an oxygen-enriched atmosphere can promote very rapid burning.\n\n6\\. _Ballasting or trimming_. Changing the position of the ballast, or trimming or in any way moving the vessel so as to expose cargo that had been previously trapped, can produce a change in the atmosphere of the tank. The atmosphere should be retested after any such move and prior to entry or work.\n\n_Section 1915.14 (a) and (b) Hot work_. This is a reminder that other sections of the OSHA shipyard safety and health standards in part 1915 should be reviewed prior to starting any hot work. Most notably, subpart D, Welding, Cutting and Heating, places additional restrictions on hot work. The requirements of §§ 1915.51 and 1915.53 must be met before hot work is begun on any metal that is toxic or is covered by a preservative coating respectively; the requirements of § 1915.54 must be met before welding, cutting, or heating is begun on any hollow containers or structures not covered by § 1915.12.\n\n_Section 1915.12(a)(2)_. During hot work, more than 20.8 percent oxygen by volume can be unsafe since it extends the normal flammable range. The standard permits the oxygen level to reach 22 percent by volume in order to account for instrument error. However, the cause of excess oxygen should be investigated and the source removed.\n\n_Section 1915.16(b)_. If the entire vessel has been found to be in the same condition, then employers shall be considered to be in compliance with this requirement when signs using appropriate warning language in accordance with § 1915.16(a) are posted at the gangway and at all other means of access to the vessel.\n\n\\[47 FR 16986, Apr. 20, 1982; 59 FR 37816, July 25, 1994; 67 FR 44541, July 3, 2002; 76 FR 33609, July 8, 2011\\]\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-THXLXTHVBH&gacid=1913045052.1732749752&gtm=45je4bk0v9108112373za200zb9131934939&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=101925629~102067555~102067808~102077855~102081485&z=1977661729)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

This subpart applies to all work in shipyard employment regardless of geographic location.\n\n1915.151(b)\n\n\n**_Definitions applicable to this subpart_**.\n\n**_Anchorage_** means a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices.\n\n**_Body belt_** means a strap with means for both securing it about the waist and attaching it to a lanyard, lifeline, or deceleration device.\n\n**_Body harness_** means straps which may be secured about the employee in a manner that will distribute the fall arrest forces over at least the thighs, shoulders, chest and pelvis with means for attaching it to other components of a personal fall arrest system.\n\n**_Connector_** means a device which is used to couple (connect) parts of a personal fall arrest system or parts of a positioning device system together. It may be an independent component of the system, such as a carabiner, or it may be an integral component of part of the system (such as a buckle or D-ring sewn into a body belt or body harness or a snaphook spliced or sewn to a lanyard or self-retracting lanyard).\n\n**_Deceleration device_** means any mechanism, such as a rope grab, ripstitch lanyard, specially woven lanyard, tearing or deforming lanyard, or automatic self-retracting lifeline/lanyard, which serves to dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a fall arrest, or otherwise limit the energy imposed on an employee during fall arrest.\n\n**_Deceleration distance_** means the additional vertical distance a falling employee travels, excluding lifeline elongation and free fall distance, before stopping, from the point at which the deceleration device begins to operate. It is measured as the distance between the location of an employee's body belt or body harness attachment point at the moment of activation (at the onset of fall arrest forces) of the deceleration device during a fall, and the location of that attachment point after the employee comes to a full stop.\n\n**_Equivalent_** means alternative designs, materials, or methods to protect against a hazard which the employer can demonstrate will provide an equal or greater degree of safety for employees than the method or item specified in the standard.\n\n**_Free fall_** means the act of falling before a personal fall arrest system begins to apply force to arrest the fall.\n\n**_Free fall distance_** means the vertical displacement of the fall arrest attachment point on the employee's body belt or body harness between onset of the fall and just before the system begins to apply force to arrest the fall. This distance excludes deceleration distance, and lifeline/lanyard elongation, but includes any deceleration device slide distance or self-retracting lifeline/lanyard extension before the device operates and fall arrest forces occur.\n\n**_Lanyard_** means a flexible line of rope, wire rope, or strap which generally has a connector at each end for connecting the body belt or body harness to a deceleration device, lifeline, or anchorage.\n\n**_Lifeline_** means a component consisting of a flexible line for connection to an anchorage at one end to hang vertically (vertical lifeline), or for connection to anchorages at both ends to stretch horizontally (horizontal lifeline), and which serves as a means for connecting other components of a personal fall arrest system to the anchorage.\n\n**_Lower levels_** means those areas or surfaces to which an employee can fall. Such areas or surfaces include but are not limited to ground levels, floors, ramps, tanks, materials, water, excavations, pits, vessels, structures, or portions thereof.\n\n**_Personal fall arrest system_** means a system used to arrest an employee in a fall from a working level. It consists of an anchorage, connectors, body belt or body harness and may include a lanyard, a deceleration device, a lifeline, or a suitable combination of these. As of January 1, 1998, the use of a body belt for fall arrest is prohibited.\n\n**_Positioning device system_** means a body belt or body harness system rigged to allow an employee to be supported at an elevated vertical surface, such as a wall or window, and to be able to work with both hands free while leaning.\n\n**_Qualified person_** means a person who by possession of a recognized degree or certificate of professional standing, or who, by extensive knowledge, training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated the ability to solve or resolve problems related to the subject matter and work.\n\n**_Restraint (tether) line_** means a line from an anchorage, or between anchorages, to which the employee is secured in such a way as to prevent the employee from walking or falling off an elevated work surface. Note: A restraint line is not necessarily designed to withstand forces resulting from a fall.\n\n**_Rope grab_** means a deceleration device which travels on a lifeline and automatically, by friction, engages the lifeline and locks so as to arrest the fall of an employee. A rope grab usually employs the principle of inertial locking, cam/level locking or both.\n\n\\[61 FR 26322, May 24, 1996\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-THXLXTHVBH&gacid=1057116653.1732749754&gtm=45je4bk0v9108112373za200zb9131934939&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=101925629~102067555~102067808~102077855~102081485&z=109534331)",

This procedure shall be used to ensure that all potentially hazardous-energy sources have been isolated and the machinery, equipment, or system to be serviced has been rendered inoperative through the use of lockout or tags-plus procedures before employees perform any servicing when the energization or start-up of the machinery, equipment, or system, or the release of hazardous energy could cause injury.\n\n**Compliance With This Program**\n\nAll employees are required to comply with the restrictions and limitations imposed on them during the use of lockout or tags-plus applications. Authorized employees are required to perform each lockout or tags-plus application in accordance with this procedure. No employee, upon observing that machinery, equipment, or systems are secured using lockout or tags-plus applications, shall attempt to start, open, close, energize, or operate that machinery, equipment, or system.\n\n* * *\n\nType of compliance enforcement to be taken for violation of the above.\n\n**Procedures for Lockout/Tags-Plus Systems**\n\n(1) Notify each affected employee that servicing is required on the machinery, equipment, or system, and that it must be isolated and rendered inoperative using a lockout or tags-plus system.\n\n* * *\n\nMethod of notifying all affected employees.\n\n(2) The authorized employee shall refer to shipyard employer's procedures to identify the type and magnitude of the energy source(s) that the machinery, equipment, or system uses, shall understand the hazards of the energy, and shall know the methods to control the energy source(s).\n\n* * *\n\nType(s) and magnitude(s) of energy, its hazards and the methods to control the energy.\n\n(3) If the machinery, equipment, or system is operating, shut it down in accordance with the written procedures (depress the stop button, open switch, close valve, etc.) established by the employer.\n\n* * *\n\nType(s) and location(s) of machinery, equipment, or system operating controls.\n\n(4) Secure each energy-isolating device(s) through the use of a lockout or tags-plus system (for instance, disconnecting, blanking, and affixing tags) so that the energy source is isolated and the machinery, equipment, or system is rendered inoperative.\n\n* * *\n\nType(s) and location(s) of energy-isolating devices.\n\n(5) _Lockout System_. Affix a lock to each energy-isolating device(s) with assigned individual lock(s) that will hold the energy-isolating device(s) in a safe or off position. Potentially hazardous energy (such as that found in capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc.) must be controlled by methods such as grounding, repositioning, blocking, bleeding down, etc.\n\n(6) _Tags-Plus System_. Affix a tag to each energy-isolating device and provide at least one additional safety measure that clearly indicates that removal of the device from the safe or off position is prohibited. Potentially hazardous energy (such as that found in capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems and air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc.) must be controlled by methods such as grounding, repositioning, blocking, bleeding down, etc.\n\n* * *\n\nType(s) of hazardous energy—methods used to control them.\n\n(7) Ensure that the machinery, equipment, or system is relieved, disconnected, restrained, or rendered safe from the release of all potentially hazardous energy by checking that no personnel are exposed, and then verifying the isolation of energy to the machine, equipment, or system by operating the push button or other normal operating control(s), or by testing to make certain it will not operate.\n\nCAUTION: Return operating control(s) to the safe or off position after verifying the isolation of the machinery, equipment, or system.\n\n* * *\n\nMethod of verifying the isolation of the machinery, equipment, or system.\n\n(8) The machinery, equipment, or system is now secured by a lockout or tags-plus system, and servicing by the authorized person may be performed.\n\n**Procedures for Removal of Lockout/Tags-Plus Systems**\n\nWhen servicing is complete and the machinery, equipment, or system is ready to return to normal operating condition, the following steps shall be taken:\n\n(1) Notify each authorized and affected employee(s) that the lockout/tags-plus system will be removed and the machinery, equipment, or system reenergized.\n\n(2) Inspect the work area to ensure that all employees have been safely positioned or removed.\n\n(3) Inspect the machinery, equipment, or system and the immediate area around the machinery, equipment, or system to ensure that nonessential items have been removed and that the machinery, equipment or system components are operationally intact.\n\n(4) Reconnect the necessary components, remove the lockout/tags-plus material and hardware, and reenergize the machinery, equipment, or system through the established detailed procedures determined by the employer.\n\n(5) Notify all affected employees that servicing is complete and the machinery, equipment, or system is ready for testing or use.\n\n\\[76 FR 24709, May 2, 2011\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Oil shall not be used to lubricate protection caps.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(2)\n\n\nWhen cylinders are hoisted, they shall be secured on a cradle, slingboard or pallet. They shall not be hoisted by means of magnets or choker slings.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(3)\n\n\nCylinders shall be moved by tilting and rolling them on their bottom edges. They shall not be intentionally dropped, struck, or permitted to strike each other violently.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(4)\n\n\nWhen cylinders are transported by vehicle, they shall be secured in position.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(5)\n\n\nValve protection caps shall not be used for lifting cylinders from one vertical position to another. Bars shall not be used under valves or valve protection caps to pry cylinders loose when frozen. Warm, not boiling, water shall be used to thaw cylinders loose.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(6)\n\n\nUnless cylinders are firmly secured on a special carrier intended for this purpose, regulators shall be removed and valve protection caps put in place before cylinders are moved.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(7)\n\n\nA suitable cylinder truck, chain, or other steadying device shall be used to keep cylinders from being knocked over while in use.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(8)\n\n\nWhen work is finished, when cylinders are empty or when cylinders are moved at any time, the cylinder valves shall be closed.\n\n\n1915.55(a)(9)\n\n\nAcetylene cylinders shall be secured in an upright position at all times except, if necessary, for short periods of time while cylinders are actually being hoisted or carried.\n\n\n1915.55(b)\n\n\n_Placing cylinders_.\n\n1915.55(b)(1)\n\n\nCylinders shall be kept far enough away from the actual welding or cutting operation so that sparks, hot slag or flame will not reach them. When this is impractical, fire resistant shields shall be provided.\n\n\n1915.55(b)(2)\n\n\nCylinders shall be placed where they cannot become part of an electrical circuit. Electrodes shall not be struck against a cylinder to strike an arc.\n\n\n1915.55(b)(3)\n\n\nFuel gas cylinders shall be placed with valve end up whenever they are in use. They shall not be placed in a location where they would be subject to open flame, hot metal, or other sources of artificial heat.\n\n\n1915.55(b)(4)\n\n\nCylinders containing oxygen or acetylene or other fuel gas shall not be taken into confined spaces.\n\n\n1915.55(c)\n\n\n_Treatment of cylinders_.\n\n1915.55(c)(1)\n\n\nCylinders, whether full or empty, shall not be used as rollers or supports.\n\n\n1915.55(c)(2)\n\n\nNo person other than the gas supplier shall attempt to mix gases in a cylinder. No one except the owner of the cylinder or person authorized by him shall refill a cylinder. No one shall use a cylinder's contents for purposes other than those intended by the supplier. Only cylinders bearing Interstate Commerce Commission identification and inspection markings shall be used.\n\n\n1915.55(c)(3)\n\n\nNo damaged or defective cylinder shall be used.\n\n\n1915.55(d)\n\n\n_Use of fuel gas_. The employer shall thoroughly instruct employees in the safe use of fuel gas, as follows:\n\n1915.55(d)(1)\n\n\nBefore connecting a regulator to a cylinder valve, the valve shall be opened slightly and closed immediately. (This action is generally termed \"cracking\" and is intended to clear the valve of dust or dirt that might otherwise enter the regulator.) The person cracking the valve shall stand to one side of the outlet, not in front of it. The valve of a fuel gas cylinder shall not be cracked where the gas would reach welding work, sparks, flame or other possible sources of ignition.\n\n1915.55(d)(2)\n\n\nThe cylinder valve shall always be opened slowly to prevent damage to the regulator. To permit quick closing, valves on fuel gas cylinders shall not be opened more than 1½ turns. When a special wrench is required, it shall be left in position on the stem of the valve while the cylinder is in use so that the fuel gas flow can be shut off quickly in case of an emergency. In the case of manifolded or coupled cylinders, at least one such wrench shall always be available for immediate use. Nothing shall be placed on top of a fuel gas cylinder, when in use, which may damage the safety device or interfere with the quick closing of the valve.\n\n1915.55(d)(3)\n\n\nFuel gas shall not be used from cylinders through torches or other devices which are equipped with shut-off valves without reducing the pressure through a suitable regulator attached to the cylinder valve or manifold.\n\n\n1915.55(d)(4)\n\n\nBefore a regulator is removed from a cylinder valve, the cylinder valve shall always be closed and the gas released from the regulator.\n\n\n1915.55(d)(5)\n\n\nIf, when the valve on a fuel gas cylinder is opened, there is found to be a leak around the valve stem, the valve shall be closed and the gland nut tightened. If this action does not stop the leak, the use of the cylinder shall be discontinued, and it shall be properly tagged and removed from the vessel. In the event that fuel gas should leak from the cylinder valve rather than from the valve stem and the gas cannot be shut off, the cylinder shall be properly tagged and removed from the vessel. If a regulator attached to a cylinder valve will effectively stop a leak through the valve seat, the cylinder need not be removed from the vessel.\n\n\n1915.55(d)(6)\n\n\nIf a leak should develop at a fuse plug or other safety device, the cylinder shall be removed from the vessel\n\n\n1915.55(e)\n\n\n_Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds_.\n\n1915.55(e)(1)\n\n\nFuel gas and oxygen manifolds shall bear the name of the substance they contain in letters at least one (1) inch high which shall be either painted on the manifold or on a sign permanently attached to it.\n\n\n1915.55(e)(2)\n\n\nFuel gas and oxygen manifolds shall be placed in safe and accessible locations in the open air. They shall not be located within enclosed spaces.\n\n\n1915.55(e)(3)\n\n\nManifold hose connections, including both ends of the supply hose that lead to the manifold, shall be such that the hose cannot be interchanged between fuel gas and oxygen manifolds and supply header connections. Adapters shall not be used to permit the interchange of hose. Hose connections shall be kept free of grease and oil.\n\n\n1915.55(e)(4)\n\n\nWhen not in use, manifold and header hose connections shall be capped.\n\n\n1915.55(e)(5)\n\n\nNothing shall be placed on top of a manifold, when in use, which will damage the manifold or interfere with the quick closing of the valves.\n\n\n1915.55(f)\n\n\n_Hose_.\n\n1915.55(f)(1)\n\n\nFuel gas hose and oxygen hose shall be easily distinguishable from each other. The contrast may be made by different colors or by surface characteristics readily distinguishable by the sense of touch. Oxygen and fuel gas hoses shall not be interchangeable. A single hose having more than one gas passage, a wall failure of which would permit the flow of one gas into the other gas passage, shall not be used.\n\n1915.55(f)(2)\n\n\nWhen parallel sections of oxygen and fuel gas hose are taped together not more than 4 inches out of 8 inches shall be covered by tape.\n\n\n1915.55(f)(3)\n\n\nAll hose carrying acetylene, oxygen, natural or manufactured fuel gas, or any gas or substance which may ignite or enter into combustion or be in any way harmful to employees, shall be inspected at the beginning of each shift. Defective hose shall be removed from service.\n\n\n1915.55(f)(4)\n\n\nHose which has been subjected to flashback or which shows evidence of severe wear or damage shall be tested to twice the normal pressure to which it is subject, but in no case less than two hundered (200) psi. Defective hose or hose in doubtful condition shall not be used.\n\n[1915.55(f)(5)](/laws-regs/interlinking/standards/1915.55(f)(5))\n\nHose couplings shall be of the type that cannot be unlocked or disconnected by means of a straight pull without rotary motion.\n\n\n1915.55(f)(6)\n\n\nBoxes used for the stowage of gas hose shall be ventilated.\n\n\n1915.55(g)\n\n\n_Torches_.\n\n1915.55(g)(1)\n\n\nClogged torch tip openings shall be cleaned with suitable cleaning wires, drills or other devices designed for such purpose.\n\n\n1915.55(g)(2)\n\n\nTorches shall be inspected at the beginning of each shift for leaking shutoff valves, hose couplings, and tip connections. Defective torches shall not be used.\n\n\n1915.55(g)(3)\n\n\nTorches shall be lighted by friction lighters or other approved devices, and not by matches or from hot work.\n\n\n1915.55(h)\n\n\n_Pressure regulators_. Oxygen and fuel gas pressure regulators including their related gauges shall be in proper working order while in use.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

First aid supplies are required to be adequate and readily accessible under paragraphs § 1915.87(a) and (d). An example of the minimal contents of a generic first aid kit for workplace settings is described in ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2009, \"Minimum Requirements for Workplace First Aid Kits and Supplies\" (incorporated by reference as specified in § 1915.5). The contents of the kit listed in this ANSI standard should be adequate for small worksites. When larger operations or multiple operations are being conducted at the same worksite, employers should determine the need for additional first aid kits, additional types of first aid equipment and supplies, and additional quantities and types of supplies and equipment in the first aid kits.\n\n2\\. In a similar fashion, employers that have unique or changing first aid needs at their worksite may need to enhance their first aid kits. The employer can use the OSHA 300 Log, OSHA 301 Incident Report form, or other reports to identify these unique problems. Consultation from the local fire or rescue department, appropriate healthcare professional or local emergency room may be helpful to employers in these circumstances. By assessing the specific needs of their worksite, employers can ensure that reasonably anticipated supplies are available. Employers should assess the specific needs of their worksite periodically, and augment first aid kits appropriately.\n\n3\\. If it is reasonably anticipated that employees will be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials while using first aid supplies, employers must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in compliance with the provisions of the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens standard, § 1910.1030(d)(3). This standard lists appropriate PPE for this type of exposure, such as gloves, gowns, face shields, masks, and eye protection.\n\n4\\. Employers who provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at their workplaces should designate who will use AEDs and train those employees so they know how to correctly use the AEDs. Although a growing number of AEDs are now designed to be used by any person, even without training, training reinforces proper use and promotes the usefulness of AEDs as part of an effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation plan. For AEDs to be effective, employers should:\n\na. Ensure that AEDs are located so they can be utilized within three to five minutes of a report of an accident or injury;\n\nb. Ensure that employees use AEDs in accordance with manufacturers' specifications; and\n\nc. Inspect, test, and maintain AEDs in accordance with manufacturers' specifications.\n\n\\[76 FR 24703, May 2, 2011\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-THXLXTHVBH&gacid=1994395967.1732749756&gtm=45je4bk0v9108112373za200zb9131934939&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=101925629~102067555~102067808~102077855~102081485&z=1902170851)",

It neither adds to or detracts from the employer's responsibility to comply with the provisions of this subpart.\n\n1\\. _Controlling hazards_. Employers and employees should not rely exclusively on PPE for protection from hazards. PPE should be used, where appropriate, in conjunction with engineering controls, guards, and safe work practices and procedures.\n\n2\\. _Assessment and selection_. Employers need to consider certain general guidelines for assessing the hazardous situations that are likely to arise under foreseeable work activity conditions and to match employee PPE to the identified hazards. The employer should designate a safety officer or some other qualified person to exercise common sense and appropriate expertise to assess work activity hazards and select PPE.\n\n3\\. _Assessment guidelines_. In order to assess the need for PPE the following steps should be taken:\n\na. _Survey_. Conduct a walk-through survey of the area in question to identify sources of hazards.\n\nCategories for Consideration:\n\n(1) Impact\n\n(2) Penetration\n\n(3) Compression (roll-over)\n\n(4) Chemical\n\n(5) Heat\n\n(6) Harmful dust\n\n(7) Light (optical) radiation\n\n(8) Drowning\n\n(9) Falling\n\nb. _Sources_. During the walk-through survey the safety officer should observe:\n\n(1) Sources of motion; for example, machinery or processes where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result in collision with stationary objects.\n\n(2) Sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury or ignition of protective equipment.\n\n(3) Types of chemical exposures.\n\n(4) Sources of harmful dust.\n\n(5) Sources of light radiation, for instance, welding, brazing, cutting, heat treating, furnaces, and high intensity lights.\n\n(6) Sources of falling objects or potential for dropping objects.\n\n(7) Sources of sharp objects which might pierce or cut the hands.\n\n(8) Sources of rolling or pinching objects which could crush the feet.\n\n(9) Layout of work place and location of co-workers.\n\n(10) Any electrical hazards.\n\n(11) Review injury/accident data to help identify problem areas.\n\n_Organize data_. Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and other information obtained. That material provides the basis for hazard assessment that enables the employer to select the appropriate PPE.\n\nd. _Analyze data_. Having gathered and organized data regarding a particular occupation, employers need to estimate the potential for injuries. Each of the identified hazards (see paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and classified as to its type, the level of risk, and the seriousness of any potential injury. Where it is foreseeable that an employee could be exposed to several hazards simultaneously, the consequences of such exposure should be considered.\n\n4\\. _Selection guidelines_. After completion of the procedures in paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is to:\n\n(a) become familiar with the potential hazards and the types of protective equipment that are available, and what they can do; for example, splash protection, and impact protection;\n\n(b) compare the hazards associated with the environment; for instance, impact velocities, masses, projectile shapes, radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available protective equipment;\n\n(c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards; and\n\n(d) fit the user with the protective device and give instructions on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that users be made aware of all warning labels and limitations of their PPE.\n\n5\\. _Fitting the device_. Careful consideration must be given to comfort and fit. The employee will be most likely to wear the protective device if it fits comfortably. PPE that does not fit properly may not provide the necessary protection, and may create other problems for wearers. Generally, protective devices are available in a variety of sizes and choices. Therefore employers should be careful to select the appropriate sized PPE.\n\n6\\. _Devices with adjustable features_. (a) Adjustments should be made on an individual basis so the wearer will have a comfortable fit that maintains the protective device in the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical splash to ensure that the seal is appropriate for the face.\n\n(b) In addition, proper fitting of hard hats is important to ensure that the hard hat will not fall off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep the hard hat on an employee's head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonably low force to prevent a strangulation hazard). Where manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed carefully.\n\n7\\. _Reassessment of hazards_. Compliance with the hazard assessment requirements of § 1915.152(b) will involve the reassessment of work activities where changing circumstances make it necessary. a. The employer should have a safety officer or other qualified person reassess the hazards of the work activity area as necessary. This reassessment should take into account changes in the workplace or work practices, such as those associated with the installation of new equipment, and the lessons learned from reviewing accident records, and a reevaluation performed to determine the suitability of PPE selected for use.\n\n8\\. _Selection chart guidelines for eye and face protection_. Examples of occupations for which eye protection should be routinely considered are carpenters, engineers, coppersmiths, instrument technicians, insulators, electricians, machinists, mobile equipment mechanics and repairers, plumbers and ship fitters, sheet metal workers and tinsmiths, grinding equipment operators, machine operators, welders, boiler workers, painters, laborers, grit blasters, ship fitters and burners. This is not a complete list of occupations that require the use of eye protection. The following chart provides general guidance for the proper selection of eye and face protection to protect against hazards associated with the listed hazard \"source\" operations.\n\n| Source | Assessment of hazard | Protection |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Impact: |  |  |\n| Chipping, grinding machining, masonry work, woodworking, sawing, drilling, chiseling, powered fastening, riveting, and sanding | Flying fragments, objects, large chips, particles, sand, dirt, etc | Spectacles with side protection, goggles, face shields.

See notes (9), (10). |\n\nEYE AND FACE PROTECTION SELECTION CHART\n\nNOTES TO EYE AND FACE PROTECTION SELECTION CHART\n\n(a) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards. Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protective devices do not provide unlimited protection.\n\n(b) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As required by the standard, protection from both hazards must be provided.\n\n(c) Face shields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles).\n\n(d) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the requirements for shade designations in § 1915.153(a)(4). Tinted and shaded lenses are not filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such.\n\n(e) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either protective devices fitted with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be worn over regular prescription (Rx) eye wear.\n\n(f) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardous environment. It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional hazard to contact lens wearers.\n\n(g) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas.\n\n(h) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing may be necessary.\n\n(i) Welding helmets or face shields should be used only over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles).\n\n(j) Non-side shield spectacles are available for frontal protection only, but are not acceptable eye protection for the sources and operations listed for \"impact.\"\n\n(k) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash entry. Eye and face protection should be designed and used so that it provides both adequate ventilation and protects the wearer from splash entry.\n\n(l) Protection from light radiation is directly related to filter lens density. See note (d). Select the darkest shade that allows task performance.\n\n9\\. _Selection guidelines for head protection_. (a) Hard hats are designed to provide protection from impact and penetration hazards caused by falling objects. Head protection is also available which provides protection from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important. Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from low-voltage conductors. (They are proof tested to 2,200 volts.) Class B helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from high-voltage conductors. (They are proof tested to 20,000 volts.) Class C helmets provide impact and penetration resistance. (They are usually made of aluminum, which conducts electricity and should not be used around electrical hazards.)\n\n(b) Where falling object hazards are present, head protection must be worn. Some examples of exposure include: working below other workers who are using tools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which are carrying parts or materials; working below machinery or processes which might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed energized conductors.\n\n(c) Examples of occupations for which head protection should be considered are: carpenters, electricians, machinists, boilermakers, erectors, plumbers, coppersmiths, ship fitters, welders, laborers and material handlers.\n\n10\\. _Selection guidelines for foot protection_.\n\n(a) Safety shoes and boots must meet ANSI Z41-1991 and provide impact and compression protection to the foot. Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal (top of foot) protection should be provided, and in some other special situations, electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes would be appropriate.\n\n(b) Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped, and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavy pipes, all of which could potentially roll over an employees' feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees, causing an injury.\n\n(c) Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection should be routinely considered are: shipping and receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, boiler makers, plumbers, copper smiths, pipe fitters, ship fitters, burners, chippers and grinders, erectors, press operators, welders, laborers, and material handlers.\n\n11\\. _Selection guidelines for hand protection_. (a) Gloves are often relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals that are capable of causing local or systemic effects following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide protection against all potential hand hazards, and commonly available glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals. Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a particular application and to determine how long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused.\n\n(b) It is also important to know the performance characteristics of gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated, e.g., chemical hazards, cut hazards, and flame hazards. These performance characteristics should be assessed by using standard test procedures. Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from the manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s) for the hazard(s) anticipated.\n\n(c) other general factors to be considered for glove selection are:\n\n(A) As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective to regularly change cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and,\n\n(B) The work activities of the employee should be studied to determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration, frequency, and degree of exposure to the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be applied.\n\n(d) With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical hazards:\n\n(A) The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in particular, the ability of the chemical to cause local effects on the skin or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects or both;\n\n(B) Generally, any \"chemical resistant\" glove can be used for dry powders;\n\n(C) For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data are available), a glove should be selected on the basis of the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for solvents to carry active ingredients through polymeric materials; and,\n\n(D) Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as to prevent skin contamination.\n\n12\\. _Cleaning and maintenance_.\n\n(a) It is important that all PPE be kept clean and be properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision.\n\n(b) For the purposes of compliance, PPE should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular intervals so that the PPE provides the requisite protection.\n\n(c) It is important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that protects employees from exposure to hazards.\n\n13\\. _Examples of work activities, trades and selection of basic PPE_.\n\n_Example 1: Welder_. Based on an assessment of the work activity area hazards to which welders are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. This does not take into account a job location in which additional PPE may be required, such as where the welder works from an elevated platform without guard rails. In this situation the welder must also wear the proper fall protection equipment, such as a body harness.\n\n—Hard hat\n\n—Welding Shield (Face)\n\n—Welding Gloves\n\n—Safety Glasses\n\n—Safety Shoes\n\n—Welding Sleeves (welding in the overhead position)\n\n(Signed and dated)\n\n_Example 2: Yard Maintenance Worker_. Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard maintenance workers are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where maintenance workers are exposed to other hazards, such as asbestos, the insulation on a pipe is being repaired, maintenance workers must be provided with the appropriate supplemental PPE (requirements for asbestos PPE are set out in 1915.1001).\n\n—Hard Hat\n\n—Safety Glasses\n\n—Work Gloves\n\n—Safety Shoes\n\n(Signed and Dated)\n\n_Example 3: Chipper and Grinder Worker_. Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard chipper and grinder workers are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where workers are exposed to other hazards, such as hazardous dust from chipping or grinding operations, chipper and grinder workers must be provided with the appropriate supplemental PPE.\n\n—Safety Glasses\n\n—Transparent Face Shields\n\n—Hearing Protection\n\n—Foot Protection\n\n—Gloves\n\n(Signed and Dated)\n\n_Example 4: Painter_. Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard painters are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where painters are exposed to other hazards, such as a fall from an elevation where no guardrails are present, painters must be provided with the appropriate supplemental PPE.\n\n—Hard Hats\n\n—Safety Glasses\n\n—Disposable Clothing\n\n—Gloves\n\n—Respiratory Protection, including Airline Respirators when working in Confined Spaces\n\n—Barrier Creams\n\n(Signed and Dated)\n\n_Example 5: Tank Cleaner_. Tank cleaning operations and the basic PPE required for them depend largely upon the type of cargo shipped in the tank. Therefore, the following example is given for a tank in which gasoline has been shipped. Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard tank cleaners are exposed, specifically benzene and flammability hazards, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this situation. Other tank cleaning operations will require variations in the PPE listed below.\n\n—Respiratory Protection, Airline Respirators for working in confined spaces or where personal exposure limits could be exceeded.\n\n—Chemically resistant clothing\n\n—Face Shields\n\n—Chemically resistant boots\n\n—Chemically resistant gloves\n\n—Fall Protection\n\n—Non sparking tools and equipment\n\n—Explosion-proof Lighting\n\n(Signed and Dated)\n\n\\[47 FR 16986, Apr. 20, 1982; 61 FR 26321, May 24, 1996; 67 FR 44544, July 3, 2002\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

(See paragraph (a)(4) above.)\n\n(2) The test consists of dropping the test weight once. A new unused system should be used for each test.\n\n(3) For lanyard systems, the lanyard length should be 6 feet plus or minus 2 inches (1.83 m plus or minus 5.08 cm) as measured from the fixed anchorage to the attachment on the body belt or harness.\n\n(4) For rope-grab-type deceleration systems, the length of the lifeline above the center line of the grabbing mechanism to the lifeline’s anchorage point should not exceed 2 feet (0.61 m).\n\n(5) For lanyard systems, for systems with deceleration devices which do not automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m) or less, and for systems with deceleration devices which have a connection distance in excess of 1 foot (0.31 m) (measured between the centerline of the lifeline and the attachment point to the body belt or harness), the test weight should be rigged to free fall a distance of 7.5 feet (2.29 m) from a point that is 1.5 feet (45.72 cm) above the anchorage point, to its hanging location (6 feet (1.83 m) below the anchorage). The test weight should fall without interference, obstruction, or hitting the floor or the ground during the test. In some cases, a non-elastic wire lanyard of sufficient length may need to be added to the system (for test purposes) to create the necessary free fall distance.\n\n(6) For deceleration device systems with integral lifelines or lanyards which automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m) or less, the test weight should be rigged to free fall a distance of four feet (1.22 m).\n\n(7) Any weight which detaches from the belt or harness should constitute failure for the strength test.\n\n(c) _Force test general_. The test consists of dropping the respective test weight once. A new, unused system should be used for each test.\n\n(1) For lanyard systems.\n\n(i) A test weight of 220 pounds plus or minus three pounds (99.79 kg plus or minus 1.36 kg) should be used (see paragraph (a)(4) above).\n\n(ii) Lanyard length should be 6 feet plus or minus 2 inches (1.83 m plus or minus 5.08 cm) as measured from the fixed anchorage to the attachment on the body belt or body harness.\n\n(iii) The test weight should fall free from the anchorage level to its handling location (a total of 6 feet (1.83 m) free fall distance) without interference, obstruction, or hitting the floor or ground during the test.\n\n(2) For all other systems. (i) A test weight of 220 pounds plus or minus 3 pounds (99.79 kg plus or minus 1.36 kg) should be used (see paragraph (a)(4) above).\n\n(ii) The free fall distance to be used in the test should be the maximum fall distance physically permitted by the system during normal use conditions, up to a maximum free fall distance for the test weight of 6 feet (1.83 m), except as follows:\n\n(A) For deceleration systems which have a connection link or lanyard, the test weight should free fall a distance equal to the connection distance (measured between the center line of the lifeline and the attachment point to the body belt or harness).\n\n(B) For deceleration device systems with integral life lines or lanyards which automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m) or less, the test weight should free fall a distance equal to that permitted by the system in normal use. (For example, to test a system with a self-retracting lifeline or lanyard, the test weight should be supported and the system allowed to retract the lifeline or lanyard as it would in normal use. The test weight would then be released and the force and deceleration distance measured.)\n\n(3) Failure. A system fails the force test if the recorded maximum arresting force exceeds 1,260 pounds (5.6 Kn) when using a body belt, or exceeds 2,520 pounds (11.21 Kn) when using a body harness.\n\n(4) Distances. The maximum elongation and deceleration distance should be recorded during the force test.\n\n(d) _Deceleration device tests–general_. The device should be evaluated or tested under the environmental conditions (such as rain, ice, grease, dirt, type of lifeline, etc.) for which the device is designed.\n\n(1) Rope-grab-type deceleration devices. (i) Devices should be moved on a lifeline 1,000 times over the same length of line a distance of not less than 1 foot (30.48 cm), and the mechanism should lock each time.\n\n(ii) Unless the device is permanently marked to indicate the type of lifelines which must be used, several types (different diameters and different materials) of lifelines should be used to test the device.\n\n(2) Other-self-activating-type deceleration devices. The locking mechanisms of other self-activating-type deceleration devices designed for more than one arrest should lock each of 1,000 times as they would in normal service.\n\n2. _Positioning device systems_–(a) _Test Conditions_.\n\n(1) The fixed anchorage should be rigid and should not have a deflection greater than .04 inches (1.02 mm) when a force of 2,250 pounds (10.01 Kn) is applied.\n\n(2) For lineman's body belts and pole straps, the body belt should be secured to a 250 pound (113.4 kg) bag of sand at a point which simulates the waist of an employee. One end of the pole strap should be attached to the rigid anchorage and the other end to the body belt. The sand bag should be allowed to free fall a distance of 4 feet (1.22 m). Failure of the pole strap and body belt should be indicated by any breakage or slippage sufficient to permit the bag to fall free to the ground.\n\n(3) For window cleaner's belts, the complete belt should withstand a drop test consisting of a 250 pound (113.4 kg) weight falling free for a distance of 6 feet (1.83 m). The weight should be a rigid object with a girth of 38 inches plus or minus four inches (96.52 cm plus or minus 10.16 cm.) The weight should be placed in the waistband with the belt buckle drawn firmly against the weight, as when the belt is worn by a window cleaner. One belt terminal should be attached to a rigid anchor and the other terminal should hang free. The terminals should be adjusted to their maximum span. The weight fastened in the freely suspended belt should then be lifted exactly 6 feet (1.83 m) above its \"at rest\" position and released so as to permit a free fall of 6 feet (1.83 m) vertically below the point of attachment of the terminal anchor. The belt system should be equipped with devices and instrumentation capable of measuring the duration and magnitude of the arrest forces. Any breakage or slippage which permits the weight to fall free of the system constitutes failure of the test. In addition, the initial and subsequent arresting force peaks should be measured and should not exceed 2,000 pounds (8.9 Kn) for more than 2 milliseconds for the initial impact, nor exceed 1,000 pounds (4.45 Kn) for the remainder of the arrest time.\n\n(4) All other positioning device systems (except for restraint line systems) should withstand a drop test consisting of a 250-pound (113.4 kg) weight falling free for a distance of 4 feet (1.22 m). The weight should be a rigid object with a girth of 38 inches plus or minus 4 inches (96.52 cm plus or minus 10.16 cm). The body belt or harness should be affixed to the test weight as it would be to an employee. The system should be connected to the rigid anchor in the manner that the system would be connected in normal use. The weight should be lifted exactly 4 feet (1.22 m) above its \"at rest\" position and released so as to permit a vertical free fall of 4 feet (1.22 m). Any breakage or slippage which permits the weight to fall free to the ground should constitute failure of the system.\n\n\\[47 FR 16986, Apr. 20, 1982; 61 FR 26321, May 24, 1996; 67 FR 44544, July 3, 2002\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

Detachable side protectors (e.g., a clip-on or slide-on side shield) meeting the pertinent requirements of this section are acceptable.\n\n\n1915.153(a)(3)\n\n\nThe employer shall ensure that each affected employee who wears prescription lenses while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards wears eye protection that incorporates the prescription in its design, unless the employee is protected by eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of either the PPE or the prescription lenses.\n\n\n[1915.153(a)(4)](/laws-regs/interlinking/standards/1915.153(a)(4))\n\nThe employer shall ensure that each affected employee uses equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number that provides appropriate protection from injurious light radiation.

Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum) operation.\n\n[1915.153(b)](/laws-regs/interlinking/standards/1915.153(b))\n\n_Criteria for protective eye and face devices_.\n\n\n[1915.153(b)(1)](/laws-regs/interlinking/standards/1915.153(b)(1))\n\nProtective eye and face protection devices must comply with any of the following consensus standards:\n\n\n1915.153(b)(1)(i)\n\n\nANSI/ISEA Z87.1-2010, Occupational and Educational Personal Eye and Face Protection Devices, incorporated by reference in § 1915.5;\n\n\n1915.153(b)(1)(ii)\n\n\nANSI Z87.1-2003, Occupational and Educational Personal Eye and Face Protection Devices, incorporated by reference in § 1915.5; or\n\n\n1915.153(b)(1)(iii)\n\n\nANSI Z87.1-1989 (R-1998), Practice for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection, incorporated by reference in § 1915.5;\n\n\n1915.153(b)(2)\n\n\nEye and face protection devices that the employer demonstrates are at least as effective as protective as eye and face protection devices that are constructed in accordance with one of the above consensus standards will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\n\n\\[61 FR 26321, May 24, 1996; 74 FR 46358, Sept. 9, 2009; 81 FR 16091, March 25, 2016; 85 FR 8732-8733, February 18, 2020\\]\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-THXLXTHVBH&gacid=1212683932.1732749761&gtm=45je4bk0v9108112373za200zb9131934939&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=101925629~102067555~102067808~102077855~102081485&z=328866815)",
