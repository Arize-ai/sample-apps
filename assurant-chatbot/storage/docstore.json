We amended and extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions within these initiatives,including further consolidation of our real estate portfolio and additional changes to our organizational structure, which we believe will drive greater operationalefficiency to support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We expect to complete these actions by mid-2024.\nIn November 2023, we realigned our executive team to support our global growth strategy by appointing Keith Meier as Chief Financial Officer and FrancescaLuthi as Chief Operating Officer. The appointments represented our ability to deploy our deep bench of talent and evolve from a position of strength.\nThroughout the year, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, generated $772.6 million in dividends or returns of capital from our subsidiaries (net ofinfusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for acquisitions or received from dispositions) and returned $352.3 million to shareholders through sharerepurchases and common stock dividends. In February 2023, we issued $175.0 million of 6.10% senior notes due 2026 and used the net proceeds, together with cashon hand, to redeem a portion of the $225.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.20% senior notes due 2023.\nSustainability Priorities\nAssurant is a purpose-driven company committed to making meaningful advancements each year to integrate our sustainability efforts into our long-termstrategy to support our business outcomes, our global business operations and our product and service offerings.

These contractsprovide consumers with coverage on mobile devices and consumer electronics and appliances, protecting them from certain covered losses. We pay the cost ofrepairing or replacing these consumer goods in the event of loss, theft, accidental damage, mechanical breakdown or electronic malfunction after the manufacturer'swarranty expires. Our strategy is to provide integrated service solutions to our clients that address all aspects of the insurance or extended service contract, includingprogram design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain services, service delivery and repairand logistics management, while ensuring exceptional customer experience measured through our net promoter scores. For example, we provide end-to-end mobiledevice lifecycle solutions in our mobile business from when the device is received and inspected, repaired or refurbished, to when it is ultimately disposed of througha sale to a third-party or used to support an insurance claim. In addition to extended protection for multiple devices, our mobile offerings include trade-in and upgradeprograms, premium technical support, including device self-diagnostic tools, and device disposition. We also sell repaired or refurbished mobile and other electronicdevices. We provide in-store, same-day device repairs to customers through our nationwide network of nearly 500 Cell Phone Repair locations. We believe that withthe required administrative capability, digital platforms enabling on-boarding, claims management and service delivery, supply chain management, technical supportinfrastructure, insurance underwriting capabilities and a variety of adjacent value-added services, like trade-in and upgrade and asset value recovery, we maintain adifferentiated position in this marketplace.\nWithin Connected Living, our global financial services business maintains a suite of protection and assurance products that deliver a combination of featuresand benefits for varying customer segment needs.

Global Lifestyle focuses on establishing strong,long-term relationships with clients that are leaders in their markets, including leading distributors of our products and services. In Connected Living, we partner withmobile service providers (including carriers, retailers, OEMs and cable operators) and financial and other institutions to market our mobile device solutions, withsome of the largest OEMs, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers (including e-commerce retailers) and cable operators to market our extended servicecontracts and related services, and with financial institutions, insurers and retailers to market our credit and other insurance products. Most of our distributionagreements are exclusive. In Global Automotive, we partner with auto dealers and agents, third-party administrators, manufacturers, equipment retailers and largebanks and financing companies to market our vehicle protection, commercial equipment-related products and other related services.\nTypically, our agreements in Global Lifestyle are multi-year with terms generally between three and five years and allow us to integrate our administrativesystems with those of our clients.\nGlobal Lifestyle is dependent on a few clients, in particular mobile service providers, and a reduction in business with or the loss of any one or more suchclients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

While smartphone penetration in the U.S., Japanese andEuropean markets is high, other markets are less mature and present growth opportunities. Global adoption of 5G by subscribers is a high priority for mobile serviceproviders. The worldwide used and refurbished smartphone market is growing, especially in newer markets like India, driven by the cost and availability of newdevices and sustainability-conscious customers.\nConsumer needs relating to mobile devices are continuing to expand in scope, particularly demand for certified pre-owned devices. We believe there are growthopportunities in bundled protection products, which support customers as they take full advantage of the features and functions of their mobile devices through theirdaily interaction with a connected world. Expanded capabilities like repair and logistics, technical support for customers and enhanced customer experience throughdigital solutions allow us to create product and service offerings that customers find compelling.

These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to thirdparties. Our inventory includes devices and parts on consignment with our nationwide network of nearly 500 Cell Phone Repair locations through which we providein-store repairs. Inventory levels may vary from period to period due to, among other things, differences between actual and forecasted demand, supply chainconstraints, the addition of new devices and parts, and strategic purchases. Payment terms with clients also vary, which may result in less inventory financed byclients and more inventory financed with our own capital.\nWe take various actions to manage our inventory, including monitoring our inventory levels, managing the timing of purchases and obtaining return rights forsome programs and devices. However, the value of certain inventory could be adversely impacted by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability ofthe devices and parts, physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing, increased competition, decreased consumer demand, including due tochanges in customer preferences and changes in client promotions, supply chain constraints, growing industry emphasis on cost containment and adverse foreigntrade relationships.

It protects both the lender\u2019s interest and the borrower\u2019s interest and equity. We also provide real estate owned (\u201cREO\u201d)insurance, consisting of insurance on foreclosed properties managed by our clients.\nIn the majority of cases, we use proprietary insurance-tracking administration systems linked with the administrative systems of our clients to monitor clients\u2019mortgage portfolios to verify the existence of insurance on each mortgaged property and identify those that are uninsured. If there is a potential lapse in insurancecoverage, we begin a process of notification and outreach to both the homeowner and the last known insurance carrier or agent through phone calls and writtencorrespondence, which generally takes up to 90 days to complete. If coverage cannot be verified at the end of this process, the mortgage servicer procures a lender-placed policy. The process of tracking voluntary coverage - including determining whether voluntary coverage is in force, the policy limits in place, the perils insuredand the deductibles, and obtaining other required insurance related information - is part of our risk exposure management for our lender-placed insurance business.The exposure management process is needed in order to underwrite the risk we assume, to understand loss exposure and to communicate with appropriate parties,including the lender, insurance agent and homeowner. Our placement rates reflect the ratio of insurance policies placed to tracked hazard loans. The homeowneralways retains the option to obtain or renew the insurance of his or her choice.\nLender-placed manufactured housing insurance. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance formanufactured housing offered through our lender-placed program. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance is issued after an insurance tracking and exposuremanagement process similar to that described above. In most cases, tracking is performed using a proprietary insurance-tracking administration system.\nLender-placed flood insurance. Lender-placed flood insurance consists of flood insurance offered through our lender-placed program. It provides collateralprotection to lenders in mortgaged properties in the event a homeowner does not maintain required flood insurance.

Lender-placed insurance products are distributed primarily through mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers and financial andother institutions. The majority of our lender-placed agreements are exclusive. Typically, these agreements have terms of three to five years and allow us to integrateour systems with those of our clients. Renters products are distributed primarily through property management companies and affinity marketing partners. We offerour voluntary insurance programs primarily through manufactured housing lenders and retailers, along with independent specialty agents. Independent specialtyagents also distribute flood products and other property products.\nGlobal Housing is dependent on a few clients, and a reduction in business with or the loss of any one or more such clients could have a material adverse effecton our results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Business, Strategic and Operational Risks \u2013 Our revenues and profits may decline if weare unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties facefinancial, reputational or regulatory issues.\u201d\nOur Addressable Markets and Market Activity\nIn the lender-placed market, placement rates have increased in certain areas due to reduced availability of voluntary homeowners\u2019 insurance. We continue tomonitor the state of the overall housing market and the potential impact of loan modifications, forbearances and foreclosure delays, including the impact to REOvolumes. Should the housing market deteriorate for a prolonged period, we could experience a longer-term increase in our placement rates over time. In addition tothe overall market, our lender-placed results are also impacted by inflation and the costs of paying claims, and the mix of loans we service.\nThe U.S. renters insurance market is a growing market with new building development, high occupancy and favorable relocation trends. We believe there isopportunity to increase our market share and attachment rates with new and existing clients through our investments in digital platforms designed to deliver superior,digital-first customer experience and our expanded offerings to provide end-to-end solutions.\nRisk Management\nWe earn premiums on our insurance products and fees for our services. Our lender-placed insurance products are not underwritten on an individual policy basis.Contracts with our clients require us to issue these policies automatically when a borrower\u2019s insurance coverage is not maintained. These products are priced to factorin the additional risk from ensuring that all client properties have continuous insurance coverage. We monitor pricing adequacy based on a variety of factors andadjust pricing as required, subject to regulatory constraints, including through a built-in annual inflation guard feature.

Our reinsurance program generally incorporatesa provision to allow for the reinstatement of coverage, which provides protection against the risk of multiple catastrophes in a single year.\nFor 2023, our property catastrophe reinsurance program included U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage providing $1.28 billion of protection in excess of a$125.0 million retention in the main reinsurance program for a first event, which decreases to $100.0 million for a second and third event. All layers of the programallow for one automatic reinstatement. When combined with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, the U.S. program was covered for gross Florida losses of up toapproximately $1.58 billion. The 2023 catastrophe reinsurance program also included Caribbean catastrophe coverage providing up to $55.0 million, in excess of a$5.0 million retention.\nFor our 2024 catastrophe reinsurance program, underlying rates are favorable from improved reinsurance market conditions.

Although we face global competition in each of our businesses, webelieve that no single competitor competes against us in all of our business lines. Across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing, we compete for business, clients,customers, agents and other distribution relationships with many insurance companies, warranty and protection companies, financial services companies, mobiledevice repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized competitors that focus on one market, product or service. We must respondto the threat of disruption by traditional players, as well as from new entrants, such as \u201cInsurtech\u201d start-up companies and others. Competition in each business isbased on a number of factors, including scope of products and services offered, ability to tailor products and services to client and consumer needs, product featuresand terms, pricing, technology offerings, diversity of distribution resources, brand recognition, costs, financial strength and ratings, resources, and quality of service,including speed of claims payment and the overall customer experience. The relative importance of these factors varies by product and market. To remain competitivein many of our businesses, we must also anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models,disruptive technology developments and alternate business models.

In the marketplace, we support social justice causes through the Assurant Foundation and we partner with nonprofit organizations to provide leadershipdevelopment opportunities.\nIn 2023, we strengthened our commitment to disability inclusion, and our President and CEO, Keith Demmings, signed the Disability:IN Pledge. Disability:INis a leading nonprofit resource for disability inclusion globally and one of our current DE&I strategic partners.\nWe also expanded our employees\u2019 participation in targeted development programs for women and underrepresented groups including representation at variousHACE (Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement), ELC (Executive Leadership Council), LEAP (Leadership Acceleration Program) and Disability:IN forums.\nPay Equity\nAssurant is committed to pay equity. Our compensation practices and programs consider a variety of factors designed to set fair and equitable compensationlevels. We take a holistic approach to evaluating and aligning roles with compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, geographicallocation, strategic importance of roles and other relevant factors. We periodically evaluate our compensation practices and for the last several years have engaged in amulti-step process to ensure that we are compensating equitably across employees performing similar job responsibilities. Results from our last review completed in2023, which examined base pay for U.S.-, U.K.-, Argentina- and Canada-based employees, confirmed that we are fairly administering pay and see no evidence ofsystemic and material pay equity issues across demographic groups for substantially similar roles. In addition, we evaluated short-term incentive pay percentageranges for the U.S. population enrolled in the short-term incentive plan and determined that those are fair and equitable. We expect to continue to assesscompensation practices annually and remain committed to remediate any significant pay disparities we may discover. We also continue to monitor and adjust marketwages as necessary to ensure we provide competitive wages, consistent with our ongoing compensation practices.\nWe remain committed to investing in our people through competitive rewards and development opportunities. We continued to reward high performers andinvest in merit increases, allocating more funding to front-line employees in recognition of the disproportionate impact of the current challenging economicenvironment. We have advanced our commitment to pay transparency, particularly in North America, by providing employees with base salary ranges for their roleand grade beginning in 2023.\nTotal Rewards and Wellbeing\nWe are committed to the health and safety of our employees as we believe the success of our business is directly connected to their wellbeing. In addition toproviding robust compensation and benefits programs and opportunities to invest in their financial future, we offer employees and their families access to a variety ofhealth and wellness programs. Our Total Rewards programs help to provide protection and security related to events that may require time away from work or thatimpact their financial wellbeing, such as paid time off, family leave, family care resources and flexible work schedules. Our Global Employee Assistance Planprovides additional support to help employees and their families access critical resources for their wellbeing, including financial, social, physical and mental health.\nTo further promote wellbeing, Assurant introduced the Virgin Pulse global wellbeing platform allowing employees to personalize their unique wellbeing goalswith access to tools, activities and ways to stay engaged and accountable for building healthy habits. Assurant also included access to the Headspace App as a no-costbenefit for all global employees, which is an additional resource for managing stress and helping to find better balance.\nWe regularly benchmark our Total Rewards against companies of similar size and industries to ensure our offerings remain competitive and solicit employeefeedback on the evolving needs of our workforce. We conducted employee focus groups that helped validate that recommended plan changes for 2023 met the needsof our diverse workforce particularly around predictability and affordability of health care costs. Additionally, there were several enhancements to benefits starting in2024, such as increased employer contributions, expanded plan offerings and more affordable virtual care and mental health access. Assurant also introduced an HRvirtual assistant to provide easy access to routine questions employees raise with the goal of improving their experience as an employee. We will continue to assessadditional opportunities across Total Rewards and Wellbeing to help attract and retain top talent.\nRecognizing the benefit of flexible work arrangements for our business, customers and employees, we continued to enable a long-term shift to a hybrid workmodel to support our business and talent strategy. A majority of our employees work virtually on a full-time or part-time basis and while we will continue toencourage purposeful in-person engagement to support our culture, team development and product innovation, we believe our hybrid work model will remain a keycompetitive advantage to support the evolving needs of our customers and employees. Within this hybrid environment, we introduced a new framework to supportenterprise engagement. We accelerated our ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given our increasingly hybrid workforce,while making necessary investments in key facilities and markets to support the long-term strategy of the Company.\n12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5724, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a9f0043-da1d-45c7-ba53-f2b832a25b2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a9f0043-da1d-45c7-ba53-f2b832a25b2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d6eddd8-402b-4ab1-ad51-b72c6568e4c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "8a3339aac1ea153971aa87cb7c3d576e606a3097658083ae35d69a5c1d833512", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Learning and Development\nLearning and development are essential to Assurant\u2019s success.

These laws generally requireinsurance companies within the insurance holding company system to register with the insurance departments of their respective states and territories of domicile andfurnish reports to such insurance departments regarding capital structure, ownership, financial condition, risk management, corporate governance, general businessoperations and intercompany transactions. These laws also require that transactions between affiliated companies be fair and equitable. In addition, certainintercompany transactions, changes of control, certain dividend payments and certain transfers of assets between the companies within the holding company systemare subject to prior notice to, or approval by, regulatory authorities in such states and territories.\nWe are licensed to sell insurance through our insurance subsidiaries in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Like all U.S. insurancecompanies, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions where they do business. In general, these regulations are designedto protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of shareholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various jurisdictionsestablish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as:\n\u2022 licensing;\n\u2022 capital, surplus and dividends;\n\u2022 underwriting requirements and limitations (including, in some cases, minimum or target loss ratios);\n\u2022 entrance into and exit from markets;\n\u2022 introduction, cancellation and termination of certain coverages;\n\u2022 statutory accounting and annual statement disclosure requirements;\n\u2022 product types, policy forms and mandated insurance benefits;\n\u2022 premium rates;\n\u2022 fines, penalties and assessments;\n\u2022 claims practices, including occasional regulatory requirements to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts;\n\u2022 transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022 the form and content of disclosures to consumers;\n\u2022 the type, amounts and valuation of investments;\n\u2022 annual tests of solvency and reserve adequacy;\n\u2022 assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the recovery of assessments through premium increases; and  \n\u2022 market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents.\nRisk-Based Capital Requirements. In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d)has established certain risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) standards applicable to life, health and property and casualty insurers. RBC, which regulators use to assess thesufficiency of an insurer\u2019s statutory capital, is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, expense, liability and reserve items. Factors are higher foritems that the NAIC views as having greater underlying risk. The NAIC periodically reviews the RBC formula and changes to the formula could occur in the future.\nIn December 2020, the NAIC adopted a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holdingcompany system, including non-U.S. entities. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of eachentity in a group in a way that applies to all groups\n15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4364, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "809f0b66-26bc-4bd4-a4e1-c39c7f638621": {"__data__": {"id_": "809f0b66-26bc-4bd4-a4e1-c39c7f638621", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39e9fba9-3b05-4313-bc4f-184117e11458", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "81e1a2b8f29270c4c80d2a7b0a52be414fb82123b666dfbbe5a3e27a957ce03e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38519a06-3dc7-4661-ad2b-54a49799ee58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27877176d1ebfbf5f376dd512733c1e90addccc5f49bb8189c251d9475bfa69f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "regardless of their structure in order to identify risks that may emanate from an insurer\u2019s holding company system. The NAIC has stated that the calculation will be aregulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. State legislatures began adoption of the group capital calculation model regulations in 2021 and stateadoption is expected to continue in 2024.\nInvestment Regulation. Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the kind, quality and concentration ofinvestments made by insurance companies. These regulations require diversification of insurance company investment portfolios and limit the amount of investmentsin certain asset categories.\nFinancial Reporting. Regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies. Our insurance subsidiaries are required to fileperiodic financial reports with insurance regulators. Moreover, states and territories regulate the form and content of these statutory financial statements.\nProducts and Coverage. Insurance regulators have broad authority to regulate many aspects of our products and services. Additionally, certain non-insuranceproducts and services we offer, such as service contracts, may be regulated by regulatory bodies other than departments of insurance and may be subject to consumerprotection laws.\nPricing and Premium Rates. Nearly all states and territories have insurance laws requiring insurers to file price schedules and policy forms with the state\u2019s orterritory\u2019s regulatory authority. In many cases, these price schedules and/or policy forms must be approved prior to use, and state and territory insurance departmentshave the power to disapprove increases or require decreases in the premium rates we charge.\nMarket Conduct Regulation. Activities of insurers are highly regulated by state and territory insurance laws and regulations, that govern the form and content ofdisclosure to consumers, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State and territory regulatory authorities enforce compliance through periodic marketconduct examinations.\nGuaranty Associations and Indemnity Funds. Most states and territories require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds,which are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. These associations may levy assessments on member insurers. In some states andterritories, member insurers can recover a portion of these assessments through premium tax offsets and/or policyholder surcharges.\nInsurance Regulatory Initiatives. The NAIC, state and territory regulators and professional organizations have considered and are considering various proposalsthat may alter or increase state and territory authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. For example, in 2021, the NAIC adopted theNAIC Real Property Lender-Placed Insurance Model Act (the \u201cLPI Model Act\u201d). The LPI Model Act governs the insurance that a mortgage servicer obtains when aborrower fails to obtain or maintain required insurance. Several states have enacted legislation that mirrors the LPI Model Act, and we expect more states to adoptsimilar legislation in 2024. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Risks \u2013 Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit ourgrowth\u201d for a discussion of the risks related to such initiatives.\nFederal Regulation\nAlthough our business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways.Impacted areas include financial services regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulationof insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013Risk Factors \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Risks \u2013 Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\u201d\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act. We are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d).ERISA places certain requirements on how we may administer employee benefit plans covered by ERISA. Among other things, regulations under ERISA setstandards for certain notice and disclosure requirements and for claim processing and appeals.\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Certain of our activities are subject to the privacy requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, along with regulationsadopted thereunder, generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal financial information is used and theopportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of certain disclosures, if applicable.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) address mortgage servicers\u2019 obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; provide certain information requested by suchborrowers; and provide protections to such borrowers in connection with lender-placed insurance.

Wecurrently expect the impact of the IRA provisions for the alternative minimum tax and excise tax to be de minimis.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) efforts around Global Pillars I and II dealing with possible new digitaltaxes and global minimum taxes could increase the Company\u2019s overall tax burden, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financialcondition. As part of the OECD\u2019s Pillar II rules, the OECD recommended a 15% global minimum tax on adjusted financial reported income. Many jurisdictions,including Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, have adopted or plan to adopt Pillar II for tax years beginning in 2024. The overall impact of theOECD\u2019s Global Pillars to the Company are uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions, the impact of future guidance, and interpretationsor rules issued by government agencies.

These regulations, which vary depending on thejurisdiction, include, among others, anti-corruption laws; solvency and market conduct regulations; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws andregulations; and corporate, employment, intellectual property and investment laws and regulations. We operate in various jurisdictions, including Canada, the U.K.,France, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Japan, South Korea,China and Singapore, and, in several of these jurisdictions, our businesses are supervised by local regulatory authorities. In fourth quarter 2023, we made the decisionto fully exit our operations in mainland China (other than Hong Kong). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report formore information.\nIn the past few years, the IAIS developed a model common framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (\u201cIAIGs\u201d), whichincludes group-wide supervisory oversight across national boundaries and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges (\u201cComFrame\u201d). ComFrame applies toentities that meet the IAIS\u2019s criteria for IAIGs and that are so designated by their group-wide supervisor. The NAIC previously adopted changes to the ModelInsurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to allow state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs.While we do not currently meet the criteria for IAIG designation, we are monitoring developments of reforms adopted by the IAIS as they influence NAIC activities,including those related to risk and group capital oversight.\nSecurities and Corporate Governance Regulation  \nAs a company with publicly-traded securities, we are subject to certain legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, includingthe rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) relating to public reportingand disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance and other matters.

Additionally, we and our subsidiaries aresubject to the corporate governance laws of our respective jurisdictions of incorporation or formation.\nConsumer Protection Laws\nNumerous federal, state and international consumer protection laws affect the Company. For example, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established theCFPB to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to theCFPB\u2019s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance businesses, the CFPB may take the position that it has the authority to regulate certain non-insurance consumerservices we provide. In addition, new or amended international regulations relating to fair value and fair treatment relating to products and services for consumers arebeing further considered or proposed, depending on the jurisdiction.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5096, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bade306-b2a5-4c00-895c-0aa344ee9e8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bade306-b2a5-4c00-895c-0aa344ee9e8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb5e51c6-8857-4e97-aaf9-32c7a7a0af67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "8b32f4c827630f545545ddbb74c71cc83395213ec72353979d8aa030f13dac53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d88a894e-d689-423c-ac95-94da81954005", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "0a262e8cb2d415b19dec8de6174854ac4e9187bad9d376a16d60284479ffc6de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Anti-Corruption Regulation\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws.

These laws and regulations arecontinuously evolving and developing. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increasedthe jurisdictional reach of the European Commission\u2019s laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, such as the public disclosure ofsignificant data breaches, privacy impact assessments, data portability and the appointment of data protection officers. Since the enactment of GDPR, other countrieswhere we conduct business have or are in the process of enacting stricter data protections laws that model GDPR, including Brazil, China, Japan and India.\nAt the state level, the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law has been enacted in multiple states, imposing an array of detailed security measures, reportingand attestation requirements on insurance companies. With respect to privacy rights, multiple states in the U.S. have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that furtherincrease privacy rights in a manner similar to the GDPR. The accelerated rate of adoption of privacy legislation by states poses challenges for businesses asimplementation and compliance may necessitate modifications to businesses processes, technological infrastructure, security measures and customer-facing websites.\nCybersecurity risks and incidents remain a focus for regulators. In July 2023, the SEC adopted new rules for public companies requiring disclosure of materialcybersecurity incidents and periodic disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Furthermore, in November 2023, the New YorkDepartment of Financial Services (the \u201cNYDFS\u201d) finalized amendments to its cybersecurity rule applicable to financial institutions licensed by the NYDFS.\nWe are monitoring increased regulatory activity related to artificial intelligence, including machine learning tools. For example, the NAIC has adopted guidingprinciples on artificial intelligence to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, professionals and stakeholders across the insurance industry as theyimplement artificial intelligence tools to facilitate operations. While not effective until adopted by a specific state, we expect these guidelines to be adopted by at leastsome states. In addition, in October 2023, the Biden administration issued an Executive Order to, among other things, establish extensive new standards for artificialintelligence safety and security. Internationally, in December 2023, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council reached politicalagreement on the terms of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, which aims to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in the European Union.\nEnvironmental Regulation  \nBecause we own and operate real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. Potential environmental liabilities and costs inconnection with any required remediation of such properties is an inherent risk in property ownership and operation. Additionally, under the laws of several states,contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup, which could have priority over the lien of anexisting mortgage against the property.

If we do not anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptivetechnology developments and alternative business models, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilledpersonnel and a high-performing workforce.\nOur strategy is focused on delivering long-term profitable growth. As part of our strategy, we are developing new and innovative products and services, andenhancing existing offerings. We are investing in technology, including artificial intelligence, and other capabilities to continuously improve the customer andemployee experience, while seeking to increase efficiencies. We will continue to incur expenses related to, among other things: investments in digital capabilities andlarge-scale, critical programs, such as technology, including global financial systems and infrastructure; research and development of new products and capabilities;scaling our global operations, including accessing the global talent hubs such as through our Global Capabilities Centers; and costs associated with theimplementation of new contracts and businesses in runoff or which we have exited or which we expect to fully exit, including sharing economy, , and improvementsin operational efficiency. In 2022 and 2023, we announced restructuring initiatives that include realigning our organizational structure and talent to support ourbusiness strategy, which has resulted in severance and employee benefits charges, and accelerating ongoing real estate consolidation efforts to support work-from-home arrangements. Actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates and we may not be able to fully realize our expected run rate savings andoperational efficiency improvements.

The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance mayhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital. See \u201c \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Our actual claims losses may exceed ourreserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital.\u201d\nBecause Global Housing\u2019s lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provideproperty coverage for client portfolios, our exposure to certain catastrophe-prone locations, such as Florida, California and Texas, may increase. The withdrawal ofother insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas, and may negatively affect our loss experienceand increase our costs.\nNegative publicity relating to our business, industry or clients may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual customers. From time to time, regulators, consumer advocacy groups,the media and individual customers may focus their attention on our products and services, which may subject us to negative publicity. We may be negativelyaffected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry, or if one of our clients, engages in practices that subject our industry or businesses tonegative publicity. Negative publicity may result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, social media, regulatory or governmental actions withrespect to our products or services and industry commercial practices. For example, regulators may submit queries to assess practices in the insurance sector thatpotentially disadvantage people of color or historically underrepresented groups in certain insurance lines of business, or whether customers have received fair valuefrom our products and services. In addition, there is increased investor and regulatory focus on sustainability matters, including diversity, equity and inclusion, andcommitment to long-term sustainability and efforts related to climate. A failure or perceived failure in our achievement of various sustainability initiatives and goalswe announce from time to time, or an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry\u2019s business activities, may subject us to negativepublicity.\nNegative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil andcriminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to marketour products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and serviceswe offer or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\nMacroeconomic, Political and Global Market Risks\nGeneral economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5190, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69847045-d355-4b6d-a700-3e8b1fe77c0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "69847045-d355-4b6d-a700-3e8b1fe77c0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6c6d8cf1-4611-4ab4-904b-b35a0fb41c9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "a89b6571c43a0e054ca3df2148252ff890dcd0ef2f9a5ec78b84666759ea121e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2c5733c-6cb3-4f20-8653-0f2892e05444", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "6b9a66022f2fa5a1048234b5a849f01e890088423d4f3bca901921607897211a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Limited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, includingin Europe, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment or labor shortages, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates,disruptive geopolitical events, including the Israel-Hamas war, China-Taiwan relations and supply chain disruptions, and other events outside of our control, such as amajor epidemic or a pandemic, political or civil unrest, or the possibility of a U.S. government shutdown or default on its debt obligations, could contribute, and insome cases have contributed, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock, andmay materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A.M. Best rates most of our domestic and certaininternational operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody\u2019s and S&P rate three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are subject to periodicreview by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Rating agencies may change their methodology or requirementsfor determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Rating agencies could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries or theenterprise, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary or at the holding company. Any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect ourstanding in the insurance industry and the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers, which could materially adversely affect our results ofoperations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintainminimum financial strength ratings, typically from A.M. Best, ranging from \u201cA\u201d or better to \u201cB+\u201d or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminatethese contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries\u2019 ratings fall below these minimums.

A downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity and ability toaccess liquidity quickly or at all, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities, and increase the expense and difficulty of financing ouroperations, including temporary financing for subsidiaries necessary to address any immediate liquidity concerns, or refinancing our existing indebtedness on similaror more favorable terms. For example, the interest rate payable on certain series of our senior notes is subject to increase if either of S&P or Moody\u2019s downgrades thecredit rating assigned to such series of senior notes to BB+ or below or to Ba1 or below, respectively. Additionally, we could be subject to more restrictive financialand operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that our credit ratingswill not be downgraded. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on our senior notes andthe impact of rating changes.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile most of our costs and revenues are in U.S. Dollars, some are in other currencies, including labor costs in our international locations and GlobalCapabilities Centers. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation, our results ofoperations, including period-over-period comparisons, have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To a large extent, we do notcurrently hedge foreign currency risk. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result inincreased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income will decrease if theU.S. Dollar strengthens against a local currency. In 2023, we reported a $31.3 million unfavorable impact to net income due to foreign exchange-related losses. Thesefluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may incur foreign exchange losses in connection with the designation of the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency of our internationalsubsidiaries.

We rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error andinternal control failure compared to automated processes. In 2022, we identified and disclosed certain accounting errors. Although we are in the process ofimplementing an integrated global financial system to, among other things, minimize our reliance on and use of manual processes, there can be no assurance that theimplementation will be completed in a timely manner or on budget, or that it will achieve all of its intended goals. Any failure to implement required controls, ordifficulties or errors encountered in their operation, including as a result of remote work arrangements, could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us tofail to meet our reporting obligations.

Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internalcontrol over financial reporting may prevent us from reporting our financial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financialinformation, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatory consequences, including fines and other sanctions, and would require us to claw back certainexecutive compensation, which would be costly and time-consuming.

Changes in interest rates have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect the performanceof some of our investments, including by materially reducing the fair value of and investment income from fixed maturity securities and increasing unrealized lossesin our investment portfolio, which can adversely impact our capital. As of December 31, 2023, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% of our totalinvestments and full year 2023 gross investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $335.3 million. The fair market value of fixed maturity securitiesgenerally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments infixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases directly with fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, actual investment income and cash flows frominvestments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as aresult of interest rate fluctuations.\nRecent periods have been characterized by an overall increase in interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at high levels may resultin greater unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Conversely, a prolonged period during which interest rates are at lower levels may result in lower-than-expected investment income. We attempt to mitigate certain interest rate risk with hedging activities but such activities may not be effective. Though we employasset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate changes, significant fluctuations may require us to liquidate investments prior tomaturity at a significant loss to pay claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \u2013Interest Rate Risk\u201d in this Report.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bondsand commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and result in realizedinvestment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, increases intreasury rates or credit spreads and by other factors that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments. Thedetermination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary impairment requires the judgment of management and there are inherent risks and uncertaintiesinvolved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments haveoccurred, which could lead to additional losses on investments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. Forfurther details on net investment losses, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nThe value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of its issuer. As of December 31, 2023, fixed maturitysecurities represented approximately 84% and below investment grade securities (rated \u201cBB\u201d or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations)represented approximately 5% of our total investments. Below investment grade securities generally are expected to provide higher returns but present greater riskand can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materiallyadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \u2013 Credit Risk\u201d in thisReport for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity securities portfolio.\nEquity securities represented approximately 3% of our total investments as of December 31, 2023. However, we have had higher percentages of equitysecurities in the past and may make more equity investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally are expected to provide higher total returns butpresent greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity securities.

Under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuationallowance, or a liability related to uncertain tax positions should be accrued, if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that someportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the samecharacter during the carryback or carry-forward periods.\nIn determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and taxcredit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The assumptions in making these judgments are updatedperiodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting us and overall economic conditions. These management judgments are therefore subject to changedue to factors that include changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or in our ability to execute othertax planning strategies.

Premiums charged for reinsurance coverage increased significantly in 2023 but have moderated slightly in 2024. In the future, we may not be able toobtain reinsurance coverage for some of our businesses at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

These parties\u2019 failure to remit all premiums collected or topay claims on our behalf or to reimburse us for paid claims on a timely and accurate basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay us sufficient dividends could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends.\nAs a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible paymentsfrom our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to repurchase shares or debt, to pay for certainexpenses, to acquire new businesses, and to pay dividends to common stockholders. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends and to make such other paymentsdepends on their GAAP equity or statutory surplus, future earnings, cash position, rating agency requirements and regulatory restrictions, as applicable. Regulatorscould increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary. Except to the extent that we are a creditor withrecognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including policyholders, have priority over our claims with respect to oursubsidiaries\u2019 assets and earnings. If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and stockholders will have no right toproceed against our subsidiary\u2019s assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of our subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-uplaws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiaryand the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary.\nThe payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) mustbe approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, arelimited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out ofearned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as paymentsunder a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that wouldotherwise be permitted without prior approval. Future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends. For moreinformation on the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us in 2023 under applicable laws and regulations,without prior regulatory approval, see \u201cItem 5 \u2013 Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \u2013 Dividend Policy.\u201d\nAny additional material restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on ourcommon stock, service our debt and pay other expenses.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by the Board in its sole discretion and will depend on variousfactors, including: our subsidiaries\u2019 payment of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financialcondition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment ofdividends; and any other factor the Board deems relevant.

Some of the Company\u2019s technology systems and software are legacy-type systemsthat are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards, including business continuityprocedures. We are undergoing a multiyear transformation of our information technology systems and infrastructure involving several enterprise-wide technologyinitiatives to support our strategy and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving industry and regulatory requirements.This includes implementing an integrated global financial system; enhancing existing systems, procedures and controls; developing new systems and products; andretiring certain legacy systems. We have also migrated many of our systems and applications to the cloud, which is key to our technology strategy. We currently relyon significant manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. We mustintegrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performancecapabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations.\nOur ability to modernize our technology systems and infrastructure requires us to execute large-scale, complex programs and projects, which rely on thecommitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes.

We are at risk of attack, and from time to time have been the subject of an attack, by a growing list of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations,organized crime, hackers and \u201chacktivists\u201d (activist hackers), through the use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including long-term, persistent attacksreferred to as advanced persistent threats, attacks via yet unknown vulnerabilities referred to as zero-day threats and credential harvesting attacks against ouremployees. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launchedagainst a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in potential data loss or other damage totechnology systems. As the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow, and as a result of the remote and hybrid work arrangements for asignificant portion of our employees, the risk of security breaches and cybersecurity incidents has increased.\nOur systems have also been subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees and third parties who may have otherwiselegitimate access to our systems. Our call centers subject us to additional risk from internal threats due to access to personal data. Moreover, we face the ongoingchallenge of managing access controls in a complex environment. Remote and hybrid work arrangements, including the use of personal devices and home networksthat are not managed by the organization\u2019s security control framework, bypass certain physical security controls for our employees and the employees of our vendorswho have access to sensitive information. While additional controls have been put in place, they may not be sufficient to discover compromises that occur due to theloss of physical controls. The latency of a compromise is often measured in months, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner.

Should an attacker gain access to ournetwork using compromised credentials of an authorized user or otherwise, or gain entry as a result of a zero-day exploit or other vulnerabilities that may exist in oursystems environment, which has occurred from time to time, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systemsand data.

Additionally, our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietaryinformation and other cybersecurity incidents, assess the severity or impact of any such incidents or appropriately respond in a timely manner. The inability toimplement, maintain and upgrade effective protective measures and other safeguards or adequately respond to a breach could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.\nAlthough we continue to invest in security and engage in best practices for software development, code vulnerabilities may still be introduced into productionenvironments. Our technology systems must be continually patched and upgraded to protect against vulnerabilities, including zero-day threats, and we are at risk thatcyber attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before they have been addressed. Due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate and theincreased frequency with which vendors issue security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors,before they can be deployed, we are at risk that we cannot deploy these patches to remediate these vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner.

The Information Technology Committee reviews theeffectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and procedures, including procedures to identify and assess internal and external risks from cybersecurity threats; controlsto prevent and protect from cyberattacks, unauthorized access or other malicious acts and risks; procedures to detect, respond to, mitigate negative effects from andremediate cybersecurity attacks; and controls and procedures for fulfilling applicable regulatory reporting and disclosure obligations of the risks and costs ofcybersecurity incidents. Our Chief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d) briefs or provides a report to the Information Technology Committee on our cybersecurityand information security posture and program at least quarterly, including penetration test results and related remediation and significant cybersecurity incidents, andalso provides an annual cybersecurity update to the full Board.\nCybersecurity risk is integrated into our Global Risk Management process. Cybersecurity risk continues to be identified as one of our key enterprise risks. Riskowners from the Management Committee, senior leadership and the Global Risk Management function have been assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, whichare tracked and reported at least quarterly to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board and annually to the Board. See \u201cItem 1 \u2013 Business \u2013 Global RiskManagement\u201d for more information on the Global Risk Management function.\nOur CISO, who reports to our Global Technology Officer on the Management Committee, has over 20 years of information technology and security programmanagement experience, holds a Certified Information Security Manager certification and has led our information security team, including information technologycompliance and risk management, since 2009. Our Global Technology Officer joined the Company in 2016 and has over 30 years of information technologyexperience, including leading global digital, security, infrastructure, cloud services and application teams. Prior to joining the Company in 2016, our GlobalTechnology Officer was chief information officer at a large, publicly-traded energy company.\nOur CISO has implemented a management-level governance structure and process to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks, and manage ouroverall information security program. The Information Security Board, led by our CISO and comprised of leaders from all of our lines of business and key functionalareas such as Global Risk Management, Privacy and Compliance, as well as members of our information security team, meets quarterly, and is responsible foroverseeing our information security program, including our information security strategy and related policies and standards. The information security team managescybersecurity risks and controls, and continually enhances a global security control framework with the ultimate goal of preventing cybersecurity incidents to theextent feasible, while simultaneously minimizing the business impact should an incident occur.\nWe have implemented cybersecurity policies and standards based on leading industry frameworks, including the ISO 27001 standard and the National Instituteof Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, and regularly assess our policies and practices, including tabletop exercises, aimed at mitigatingcybersecurity risks.

A cybersecurity incident at a vendor or other third party could materially adversely impact us. We assess third-party cybersecurity controls through acybersecurity questionnaire and a review of independent cybersecurity rating assessments.

We may seek approval of regulators to pay dividends in excess of any amounts that would bepermitted without such approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would obtain such approval if sought. Our international and non-insurance subsidiariesprovide additional sources of dividends. Dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used foracquisitions or received from dispositions, was approximately $772.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $622.7 million was generated by ourU.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries.\nPayments of dividends on shares of common stock may be subject to the preferential rights of any preferred stock that the Board may create from time to time.In addition, the Credit Facility restricts payments on our capital stock, including common stock dividends, if an event of default has occurred or if a proposedcommon stock dividend payment would cause an event of default under the Credit Facility.

Connected Living results were upmodestly, as stronger mobile device protection results in North America and higher investment income were partially offset by lower mobile results in Asia Pacific.\nGlobal Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $499.5 million, or 6%, to $8.56 billion for the Twelve Months 2023 from $8.06 billionfor Twelve Months 2022, primarily due to prior period sales within Global Automotive.\nGlobal Housing Adjusted EBITDA increased $328.2 million, or 133%, to $574.2 million for Twelve Months 2023 from $246.0 million for Twelve Months 2022,primarily driven by the factors noted below, including $60.4 million of lower pre-tax reportable catastrophes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4852, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea43c335-3793-4efb-80f0-9d447c8370ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea43c335-3793-4efb-80f0-9d447c8370ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9aa7fde5-aff0-4e87-84fe-f001447015ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "98cefb11a0d44c96210a743505c5597133f6433a535425f1da9a2cdbe29a908e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f7ffcaa-847a-4105-8681-ab0bdabb4d77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "b441097ecadec0b1a5f58b21e6dcf4a65c7e1f94a90a347c7b1dfbcd3abe5095", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDAincreased $267.8 million, or 64%, mainly due to lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including $54.1 million of favorable prior year reserve development in 2023compared\n45", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4853, "end_char_idx": 5076, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9686a871-591e-4ac2-83f0-bbdcd528c9fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "9686a871-591e-4ac2-83f0-bbdcd528c9fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a29984b-3069-42be-9075-b28be15ea83f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "7da536e57d983ad0eafb3392a2b769440200af5fe93cefdb06ca028b5cde93e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e89e8af-d50d-4486-96af-afa37635e59b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63cfafaa275c76a519afdd2f19f2cd0660bf9fb60c091ecfb84bb0270609fa33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "to $15.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2022.

Differences between actual results and these estimates andjudgments could in some cases have material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following critical accounting policies require significantestimates and judgment:\n\u2022 Reserves, Net of Reinsurance\n\u2022 Valuation of Investments\n\u2022 Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill\nReserves, Net of Reinsurance\nReserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect significant judgment and estimates about expected future claim payments.Factors used in their calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. Calculations incorporate assumptions aboutthe incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internalclaims processing costs and other relevant factors. While the methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed andupdated, the estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is using historical information and methods to project future events andreserve outcomes. \nThe recorded reserves represent our best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, basedupon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves may be impacted by futuretrends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, including:changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handlingprocedures.\nMany of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. Reserve estimates are refined asexperience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which suchestimates are updated. \nBecause establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that futuresettlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves.

Reinsurance premiums paid areamortized as reductions to premium over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistentwith claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. Reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers for claimspaid as well as those included in reserve estimates that are subject to the reinsurance.\nWe use a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating an expected credit loss allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers areused in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims andbenefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld,assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral.Our methodology incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratingsservice. The allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevantfactors.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies.

Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptionswhere necessary.\nUltimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. Both paid claims development as well ascase incurred development are typically analyzed at the product or product grouping level, considering product size and data credibility. The reserving methodswidely employed by us include the Chain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. For Global Housing, reportable catastrophes areanalyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach.\nThe methods all involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. As thedata ages, development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting loss development factorsindicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The underlying premise of the Chain Laddermethod is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method employs a combination of pastclaims development and prior estimates of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. The Munich Chain Ladder method incorporates the correlations betweenpaid and incurred development in projecting future development factors, and is typically more applicable to products experiencing variability in incurred to paidratios.\nEach of these methods applied to the data groupings produces an estimate of the loss reserves for the product grouping. The best estimate is generally selectedfrom a blend of the different methods. The IBNR associated with the best estimate is then allocated to accident year based on a weighting of the underlying actuarialmethods. The determination of the best estimate is based on many factors, including:  \n\u2022 the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions;\n\u2022 the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data;\n\u2022 current and expected future economic and market conditions;\n\u2022 regulatory, legislative, and judicial considerations;\n48", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4934, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e0190ca-5ae1-40b2-ba0b-7564c0ddf863": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e0190ca-5ae1-40b2-ba0b-7564c0ddf863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3126e211-1ea9-4445-afdf-2561184d14af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "061993286b8e6318e21e8bbf50df21ec9e645b940369b668b335e8afa04c3fcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022 the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply;\n\u2022 trends in loss frequency and severity for various causes of loss;\n\u2022 consideration of the distribution of loss reserves, management\u2019s selection of the best estimate that may exceed an estimate based on median values,suggesting that favorable development may be more likely than unfavorable development; and\n\u2022 hindsight testing of prior loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others.\nWhen employing the reserving methods, consideration is given to contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, coveragechanges, seasonality, product mix, the legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors, natural catastrophes and other relevant factors. We consistently applyreserving principles and methodologies from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.\nWhile management has used judgment in establishing its best estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantlydifferent reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and lossseverity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls, changes in economic activityand weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. \nIf the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management\u2019s estimate.The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2023 would be as follows:\nChange in both loss frequency and severityfor all Global Lifestyle and Global Housing Ultimate cost of claimsoccurring in 2023 Change in cost of claimsoccurring in 2023\n3% higher $ 1,692.2 $ 97.1 2% higher $ 1,659.5 $ 64.4 \n1% higher $ 1,627.2 $ 32.1 Base scenario (1) $ 1,595.1 $ \u2014 1% lower $ 1,563.4 $ (31.7)\n2% lower $ 1,531.9 $ (63.2)3% lower $ 1,500.8 $ (94.3)\n(1) Represents the sum of the case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves as of December 31, 2023 for Global Lifestyle and Global Housing.\n Non-Core Operations\nShort duration contracts in non-core operations primarily consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within GlobalHousing. While the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tailcompared to property coverages which make up most of our core operations.\nThe reserving methodology described for other short duration contacts is applicable for non-core operations. Given the nature of commercial liability coveragesand its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on elevated loss activity from increasing attorney involvement and analysis of individualcase reserve adequacy on known claims. This is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include an allowance for future inflation impacts, detailedopen claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement our own historical claims experience.\nLong Duration Contracts, including Disposed and Runoff Long Duration Lines\nReserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future netpremiums. Reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. Theseassumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions forpossible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in ourconsolidated statements of operations.\nRisks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity and long-term care insurance policies have been fully ceded viareinsurance. While we have not been released from our contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity,and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assumingreinsurer.\n49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4728, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "311e30f3-f966-44a4-a9f2-cae89c4449cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "311e30f3-f966-44a4-a9f2-cae89c4449cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e60f57e3-90d3-47f9-aaea-e9fde5016aaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "084c8ba66d0a9b668178db948a12dee4f23662c415c2c50d55b3240b995a0dbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Valuation of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in activemarkets that are readily and regularly obtainable.

We review our goodwillannually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legalfactors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows dueto changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. Any adversechange in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business forwhich discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can beaggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value,including goodwill, of the reporting unit over its fair value. An impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nOur Global Lifestyle operating segment is disaggregated into two reporting units: Connected Living and Global Automotive. Our reporting unit for goodwilltesting was at the same level as the operating segment for Global Housing.\nThe following table illustrates the amount of goodwill carried by operating segment as of the dates indicated:\n December 31,\n 2023 2022\nGlobal Lifestyle (1) $ 2,292.1 $ 2,193.9 Global Housing 316.7 409.1 \nTotal $ 2,608.8 $ 2,603.0 \n(1) As of December 31, 2023, $785.2 million and $1,506.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living and Global Automotive reporting units, respectively. As of December 31, 2022,$761.0 million and $1,432.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living (including Global Financial Services which was aggregated with Connected Living in 2023) and GlobalAutomotive reporting units, respectively.\nQuantitative Impairment Testing\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment for the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting units given the uncertainty inmacro-economic conditions and inflation concerns. Based on this quantitative assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the reportingunits\u2019 fair values were more than their carrying amounts and that there was no impairment for the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting units as of October1, 2023.\nThe determination of fair value of the reporting units requires many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include earnings and requiredcapital projections discussed above, discount rates, terminal growth rates, operating income and dividend forecasts for each reporting unit and the weighting assignedto the results of each valuation method included in the fair value calculation. Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwillimpairment assessment.\n50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4785, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24cef0eb-ed40-42fe-bf1f-2a2445319abf": {"__data__": {"id_": "24cef0eb-ed40-42fe-bf1f-2a2445319abf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f951124d-83d5-4e11-b8e7-1614e68e24ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "89557ee29d1c997519100eb4c96a4e4bb55da4584abacc61c1c365c79563624b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Should the operating results of these reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, or should further interest rate declines increase the netunrealized investment portfolio gain position, we could determine that we need to perform an updated impairment test due to the potential impairment indicators,which may require the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in any of the reporting units.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023 quantitative assessment, had the net book value for the reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value, the Company wouldhave recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the difference up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nRefer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for further detail.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nResults of Operations\nAssurant Consolidated\nThe table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations:\n For the Years Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022\nRevenues:\nNet earned premiums $ 9,388.0 $ 8,765.3 Fees and other income 1,323.2 1,243.3 Net investment income 489.1 364.1 \nNet realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities (68.7) (179.7)\nTotal revenues 11,131.6 10,193.0 \nBenefits, losses and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits 2,521.8 2,359.8 Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 7,695.1 7,366.3 Goodwill impairment \u2014 7.8 \nInterest expense 108.0 108.3 Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.1) 0.9 \nTotal benefits, losses and expenses 10,324.8 9,843.1 \nIncome before provision for income taxes 806.8 349.9 \nProvision for income taxes 164.3 73.3 Net income $ 642.5 $ 276.6 \nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nNet Income\nConsolidated net income increased $365.9 million, or 132%, to $642.5 million for Twelve Months 2023 from $276.6 million for Twelve Months 2022,primarily driven by higher lender-placed net earned premiums and lower non-catastrophe loss experience in our Homeowners business within Global Housing, a$104.3 million decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities and $47.6 million of lower after-tax reportablecatastrophes. Also contributing to the increase was a $24.7 million after-tax decline in losses related to our non-core operations and a $14.7 million reduction in after-tax restructuring costs related to our previously announced restructuring plan.

The timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on various factors, including those listed above.\nAssurant Subsidiaries\nThe primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and netinvestment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries\u2019 funds inorder to generate investment income.\nWe conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for oursignificant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance withformal company-wide Asset Liability Management guidelines. \nTo complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a varied set ofplausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities,our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. For risks related to modeling, see \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Financial Risks\u2013Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving andcapital management.\u201d\nAlternative asset portfolio asset allocations are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from theseprofiles given our return hurdle and risk appetite. Scenario testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed.\nOur liabilities generally do not include policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is generally insensitive to the interest rateenvironment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid public fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securitiesinvested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs.\nGenerally, our subsidiaries\u2019 premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims andexpenses. However, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we haveseveral options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries\u2019 investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuingcommercial paper, or drawing funds from the Credit Facility.\n57", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3934, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cbde453-2125-4fce-85ac-cbe21549342a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cbde453-2125-4fce-85ac-cbe21549342a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3b76c9d-3958-4a81-a792-514a937985f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "d63b41aeb4a403ed0a9cf56be919ceb52e9459b5bdd8e3dd1eb8a0e7a02e0c08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "117e21fd-628f-414c-995f-a8e4aae1999d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0e850d418f3449be78868224a97f6692fb6eca3d38fa3de2ed38a90426609a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Senior and Subordinated Notes \nThe following table shows the principal amount and carrying value of our outstanding debt, less unamortized discount and issuance costs as applicable, as ofDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nPrincipal Amount Carrying Value Principal Amount Carrying Value\n4.20% Senior Notes due September 2023 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 225.0 $ 224.7 6.10% Senior Notes due February 2026 175.0 173.7 \u2014 \u2014 4.90% Senior Notes due March 2028 300.0 298.2 300.0 297.8 \n3.70% Senior Notes due February 2030 350.0 347.9 350.0 347.6 2.65% Senior Notes due January 2032 350.0 347.0 350.0 346.7 6.75% Senior Notes due February 2034 275.0 272.7 275.0 272.5 \n7.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 400.0 397.0 400.0 396.5 \n5.25% Subordinated Notes due January 2061 250.0 244.1 250.0 244.1 \nTotal Debt $ 2,080.6 $ 2,129.9 \n2026 Senior Notes: In February 2023, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million, which bear interest at a rate of 6.10% peryear, mature in February 2026 and were issued at a 0.035% discount to the public (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d).

The change in netfinancing cash flows was primarily due to lower share repurchases during Twelve Months 2023.\n59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3241, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fb12392-edad-4f92-8182-d54091fd463b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fb12392-edad-4f92-8182-d54091fd463b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f0b192d-33cd-4983-8a45-2a8ec7629330", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "82a4b1a92ddd9fd9c863a05c8830f08d3f1383de25c080641f6bb7361c598cb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8c8dd608-e657-4742-a4d2-7b4237590fa2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e3d7865d7dddf04867442c529dcf0186b093705f12ae2c641d8e61c2717f274", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The table below shows our cash outflows for taxes, interest and dividends for the periods indicated:\n For the Years Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\nIncome taxes paid $ 235.4 $ 127.7 $ 221.1 Interest paid on debt 107.4 108.6 109.8 Common stock dividends 152.3 150.2 157.6 \nPreferred stock dividends \u2014 \u2014 4.7 \nTotal $ 495.1 $ 386.5 $ 493.2 \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations, as detailed in the table below by maturity date as of December31, 2023: \n As of December 31, 2023\n Total Less than 1Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than 5Years\nContractual obligations:\nInsurance liabilities (1) $ 1,878.8 $ 1,295.1 $ 452.7 $ 70.0 $ 61.0 Debt and related interest 3,725.7 107.3 384.2 485.9 2,748.3 Operating leases 37.8 15.8 16.0 5.4 0.6 \nPension obligations and postretirement benefits(2) 486.2 57.4 103.1 99.1 226.6 Commitments:\nInvestment purchases outstanding:Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1.4 1.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Capital contributions to non-consolidatedVIEs 121.4 121.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Liability for unrecognized tax benefits 19.2 \u2014 15.6 \u2014 3.6 \nTotal obligations and commitments $ 6,270.5 $ 1,598.4 $ 971.6 $ 660.4 $ 3,040.1 \n(1) Insurance liabilities reflect undiscounted estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders, net of expected future premium cash receipts on in-force policies and excluding fully reinsured runoffoperations.

Market risk is dependent on the volatility and liquidity in the underlying markets inwhich these assets are traded.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities, denominated in both U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changesin interest rates, including impacts of changes in credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk from counterparties. The majority of our fixed incomeportfolio is classified as available for sale. The carrying value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $8.22 billion and $7.52 billion,respectively, of which 84% was invested in fixed maturity securities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the possibility that the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interestrates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors.\nOur investment portfolio, including our fixed maturity portfolio, has exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in investment values attributable to interest ratechanges are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our liabilities. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviewsof our asset and liability positions and we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquiditytailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Portfolio duration is primarily managed through cash markettransactions.

We monitor market interest rates and evaluate refinancingopportunities for our debt obligations as maturity dates approach. We stagger the maturity dates of our debt to mitigate the interest rate risk in any given year.

Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchangerates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in onecurrency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. To manage foreign exchange risk, our general principle is to invest in assets that match thecurrency in which we expect liabilities to be paid.

Based on such evaluation, management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded thatas of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in ourreports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Our CEO and CFOalso have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, information that we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated andcommunicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for us as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. \nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting andthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes policies andprocedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, andthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) providereasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effecton the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections ofany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nOur management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2023 using criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (COSO). \nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, based on its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, has concluded that our internal control overfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, orare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteriaestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity withaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for itsassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reportingappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control overfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing andevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nF-1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5506, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "135fe492-764c-49cc-8e4c-8ff987469043": {"__data__": {"id_": "135fe492-764c-49cc-8e4c-8ff987469043", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2c3e8d3-8302-443a-bd6f-254f990a8aae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "c3aef434a034adf78eeedcb204e91f2a59fd40591880937c3af1b91489f7f51f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the criticalaudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Claims and Benefits Payable Reserves for Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and Non-Core Operations Short Duration Insurance Contracts\nAs described in Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration insurancecontracts. Reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future claim payments. The reserve liability isbased on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s total liability for claims and benefits payable was $1.99 billion,which included $1.79 billion of liabilities for short duration contracts within the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting segments as well as within its non-core operations. Claims and benefits payable reserves include case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; incurred but not reportedreserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported as of the balance sheet date; and loss adjustment expense reserves for the expectedhandling costs of settling the claims. Factors used in the calculation of the reserves include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarialassumptions. As described by management, the best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense is generally selected from a blend of different actuarialmethods that are applied consistently each period, considering significant assumptions including projected loss development factors and expected loss ratios.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for short durationinsurance contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining their estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarial methods and projected loss development factors and expectedloss ratio assumptions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for short durationinsurance contracts, including controls over the selection of actuarial methods, completeness and accuracy of claims data and the development of the significantassumptions. On a test basis, these procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of historical claims data provided by managementand the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in either (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the estimates byevaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial methods and the reasonableness of projected loss development factors and expected loss ratio assumptions;or (ii) developing an actuarially determined independent estimate utilizing actual historical data and loss development patterns, as well as industry data and otherbenchmarks, and comparing this independent estimate to management\u2019s actuarially determined reserves.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New YorkFebruary 15, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2000.\nF-2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4310, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b54da79-f06e-4aaa-84b2-a7b446f4a0af": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b54da79-f06e-4aaa-84b2-a7b446f4a0af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "034814a3-4aad-404f-9a28-7d9767477832", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "8ffa9073663201da1b03991f34a411fc219516cbba4a6d456cc05bbc24e932b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Assurant, Inc.Consolidated Balance SheetsAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022\n December 31,\n 2023 2022\n(in millions except number of shares and per share amounts)Assets\nInvestments:\nFixed maturity securities available for sale, at fair value (amortized cost \u2013 $7,292.4 and $6,920.8 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) $ 6,912.1 $ 6,283.7 \nEquity securities at fair value 223.0 281.3 \nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate, at amortized cost (net of allowances for credit losses of $4.0 and $1.8 at December 31, 2023 and 2022,respectively) 328.7 295.6 \nShort-term investments 258.1 155.5 \nOther investments 499.0 508.4 \nTotal investments 8,220.9 7,524.5 \nCash and cash equivalents 1,627.4 1,536.7 \nPremiums and accounts receivable (net of allowances for credit losses of $9.0 and $9.2 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) 2,265.6 2,406.4 \nReinsurance recoverables (net of allowances for credit losses of $4.8 and $5.4 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) 6,649.2 6,999.4 \nAccrued investment income 97.0 85.1 \nDeferred acquisition costs 9,967.2 9,677.1 \nProperty and equipment, net 685.8 645.1 \nGoodwill 2,608.8 2,603.0 \nValue of business acquired 83.9 262.8 \nOther intangible assets, net 567.1 638.9 \nOther assets (net of allowances for credit losses of $0.7 and $1.7 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) (1) 862.3 738.3 \nTotal assets $ 33,635.2 $ 33,117.3 \nLiabilities\nFuture policy benefits and expenses $ 487.2 $ 507.9 \nUnearned premiums 20,110.4 19,802.4 \nClaims and benefits payable 1,989.2 2,210.0 \nCommissions payable 542.8 647.5 \nReinsurance balances payable 430.1 492.8 \nFunds held under reinsurance 392.7 366.6 \nAccounts payable and other liabilities (including allowances for credit losses of $8.3 and $10.3 at December 31, 2023 and 2022) 2,792.7 2,731.5 \nDebt 2,080.6 2,129.9 \nTotal liabilities 28,825.7 28,888.6 \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 27)\nStockholders\u2019 equity\nCommon stock, par value $0.01 per share, 800,000,000 shares authorized, 54,252,083 and 55,126,470 shares issued and 51,955,994 and 52,830,381 sharesoutstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively 0.6 0.6 \nAdditional paid-in capital 1,668.5 1,637.8 \nRetained earnings 4,028.2 3,699.3 \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (765.0) (986.2)\nTreasury stock, at cost;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(\u201cGAAP\u201d). Amounts are presented in United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Dollars and all amounts are in millions, except for number of shares, per share amounts andnumber of securities. Certain prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the realignment of the composition of its reportable segments to correspond withchanges to its operating structure effective January 1, 2023.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries, generally through a greater than 50% ownership ofvoting rights and voting interests. Equity investments in entities that the Company does not consolidate, but where the Company has significant influence or wherethe Company has more than a minor influence over the entity\u2019s operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. Non-controlling interestconsists of equity that is not attributable directly or indirectly to the Company. All material inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.In order to facilitate the Company\u2019s closing process, financial information from certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one to three-month lag.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The items affected by the useof estimates include but are not limited to, investments, reinsurance recoverables, premium and accounts receivables, deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d), value ofbusiness acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d), deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances, goodwill, intangible assets, future policy benefits and expenses, unearnedpremiums, claims and benefits payable, deferred gain on disposal of businesses, pension and post-retirement liabilities and commitments and contingencies. Theestimates are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commissions and other acquisition expenses, policyholder behavior and otherfactors. Actual results could differ from the estimates recorded. The Company believes all amounts reported are reasonable and adequate.\nFair Value\nThe Company uses an exit price for its fair value measurements. An exit price is defined as the amount received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability inan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In measuring fair value, the Company gives the highest priority to unadjusted quotedprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. See Note 10 for additional information.\nForeign Currency\nFor foreign affiliates where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses net of deferred income taxeshave been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d). For Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, deferred taxes have not been providedfor unrealized currency translation gains and losses since the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in these other jurisdictions. Transaction gains andlosses on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidatedstatements of operations during the period in which they occur.\nManagement generally identifies highly inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rates over a three-year period exceeds 100%, inaddition to considering other qualitative and quantitative factors. Beginning July 1, 2018, as a result of the classification of Argentina\u2019s economy as highlyinflationary, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to U.S. Dollars. The subsidiaries\u2019 non-U.S. Dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities have been subject to remeasurement since July 1, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, theremeasurement resulted in $29.4 million, $16.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, of net pre-tax losses which the Company classified within underwriting,selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the relative size of the subsidiaries\u2019 operations and net assetssubject to remeasurement, the Company does not anticipate the ongoing remeasurement to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financialcondition.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company may enter into agreements with other entities that are deemed to be variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Entities that do not have sufficient equityat risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of acontrolling financial interest are referred to as VIEs. A VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest(the \u201cprimary beneficiary\u201d) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s\nF-9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5384, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0939131e-7f75-4887-b24a-eb98269dec7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0939131e-7f75-4887-b24a-eb98269dec7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b754ee6b-a71b-4cf0-b848-082e81c74402", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "434c3d2701b46f9b0d38cc3e31884b373fc2ecca8d4eca09652c00cc18aa1827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c88cd58-4ca5-4293-8d06-c2943c786974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58ac3c01d325708c2a1b0ef70a8a844d659854e4fdb6519aecba386374768df3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

The Company only holds non-consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInvestments\nFixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale as defined in the investments guidance and are reported at fair value. If the fair value is higher thanthe amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain; and, if lower than amortized cost, the difference is an unrealized loss. Net unrealizedgains and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale, less deferred income taxes, are included in AOCI.\nPresentation of credit-related impairments is shown as an allowance, recognizing credit impairments upon purchase of securities as applicable, and requiringreversals of previously recognized credit-related impairments when applicable.\nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for which the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely thannot that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted fromcredit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes to thecredit rating of the security by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry orgeographic area, among other factors. If this assessment indicates a potential credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected arecompared to the security\u2019s amortized cost basis. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit-relatedimpairment exists, and a charge to income and an associated allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit-related impairment. Any impairment not related tocredit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which fair value is less thanthe amortized cost basis. Upon recognizing a credit-related impairment, the cost basis of the security is not adjusted.\nSubsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. For fixed maturities where the Companyrecords a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value. Write-offs are chargedagainst the allowance when management concludes the financial asset is uncollectible. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, theeffective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par.\nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities that the Company intends to sell, or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sellbefore recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment loss, or difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security, is recognized innet realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities. The new cost basis of the security is the previous amortized cost basis less theimpairment recognized and is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe Company reports receivables for accrued investment income separately from fixed maturities available for sale and elected not to measure allowances forcredit losses for accrued investment income as uncollectible balances are written off in a timely manner.\nEquity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains (losses) oninvestments and fair value changes to equity securities on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The Company has certain equity investments that donot have readily determinable fair values and the Company has elected the measurement alternative to carry such investments at cost, less impairment and to mark tofair value when observable prices in identical or similar investments from the same issuer occur.\nEquity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative are impaired if a qualitative assessment based upon several indicators such as earningsperformance, offers to sell or purchase, ability to continue as a going concern and macroeconomic factors indicates the equity investment is impaired and the fairvalue of the investment is less than its carrying value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5063, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c88cd58-4ca5-4293-8d06-c2943c786974": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c88cd58-4ca5-4293-8d06-c2943c786974", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b754ee6b-a71b-4cf0-b848-082e81c74402", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "434c3d2701b46f9b0d38cc3e31884b373fc2ecca8d4eca09652c00cc18aa1827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0939131e-7f75-4887-b24a-eb98269dec7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "329b605e306e70db25123de46ec4aa63266af64bad6395081a9ca434a307edfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If a qualitative assessment indicates impairment, a quantitative analysis, which uses probability weightedpotential outcomes, is performed to determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized that result in a fair value measurement.

The loss given default is driven primarily by the type and valueof underlying collateral, and to a lesser extent by expected liquidation costs and time to recovery. Each loan is analyzed individually based on loan-specific dataelements to estimate the expected loss and then aggregated.\nThe Company places loans on nonaccrual status after 90 days of delinquent payments (unless the loans are secured and in the process of collection). A loan maybe placed on nonaccrual status before this time if information is available that suggests collection is unlikely. The Company charges off loan and accrued interestbalances that are deemed uncollectible. Charge offs are recorded to net income in the period deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 5 for further details on theallowance for credit losses on commercial mortgage loans.\nShort-term investments include securities and other investments with durations of one year or less, but greater than three months, between the date of purchaseand maturity. These amounts are reported at cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value.\nOther investments consist primarily of investments in joint ventures, partnerships, equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, investedassets associated with a modified coinsurance arrangement, invested assets associated with the Assurant Investment Plan (the \u201cAIP\u201d), the American SecurityInsurance Company Investment Plan (the \u201cASIC\u201d) and the Assurant Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cADC\u201d), as well as policy loans. The joint ventures andpartnerships are valued according to the equity method of accounting. In applying the equity method, the Company uses financial information provided by theinvestee, generally on a three-month lag. The invested assets related to the modified coinsurance arrangement, the AIP, the ASIC and the ADC are classified astrading securities. Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances, which do not exceed the cash surrender value of the underlying policies.\nRealized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized on the specific identification basis.\nInvestment income is recorded as earned and reported net of investment expenses. The Company uses the interest method to recognize interest income on itscommercial mortgage loans.\nThe Company anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of the effective yield for mortgage-backed securities and structured securities. Theretrospective method is used to adjust the effective yield for the majority of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed and structured securities. For credit-sensitive or creditimpaired structured securities, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis, primarily our commercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed andasset backed securities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid securities and other investments with durations of three months or less between the date of purchase and maturity to becash equivalents. These amounts are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash balances are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine ifnegative cash balances exist. If negative cash balances exist, the cash accounts are netted with other positive cash accounts of the same bank provided the right ofoffset exists between the accounts. If the right of offset does not exist, the negative cash balances are reclassified to accounts payable and other liabilities.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, of $35.1 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, principally related to cash depositsinvolving insurance programs with restrictions as to withdrawal and use, are classified within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nReinsurance\nFor both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met,the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue orexpense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and areasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contractsshould be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.\nReinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholderbenefits and policyholder contract deposits.

The Company uses a probability of default and lossgiven default methodology in estimating the allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers are used in determining the probability of default. The allowance isestablished for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to creditrisk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurancearrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. The methodology used by the Company incorporates historical defaultfactors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. The allowance is based upon theCompany\u2019s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors.\nFunds held under reinsurance represent amounts contractually held from assuming companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements, primarily fromcollateral considerations.\nReinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates, which are based on bothpayments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the periodin which they are determined.\nPremiums and Accounts Receivable\nPremiums and accounts receivable includes insurance premiums receivable from policyholders and amounts due from sponsors or agents. The Companyaccounts for credit losses using the expected credit loss model for premiums and accounts receivable. For receivables due directly from the insured or consumer, theallowance for credit losses is generally calculated by aging the receivable balances and applying default factors based on the Company\u2019s historical collection data.For receivables due from product sponsors or agents, receivable balances are generally segregated by the sponsor or agent and an appropriate default factor isdetermined based on creditworthiness, billing terms and aging of balances. The financial exposure of a credit loss is determined net of offsets (such as relatedunearned premium reserves for consumer receivables and receivables net of commissions payable, profit share liabilities and captive reinsurance for balances duefrom sponsors/agents) prior to applying a default factor.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nOnly direct and incremental costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts are deferred to the extent that such costs aredeemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions and premium taxes. Certain direct responseadvertising expenses are deferred when the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who can be shown to have specifically responded to theadvertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits.\nAll other acquisition-related costs, including those related to general advertising and solicitation, market research, agent training, product development,unsuccessful sales and underwriting efforts, as well as all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred.\nPremium deficiency testing is performed annually and generally reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of assumptions including the anticipation ofinvestment income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent apremium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the consolidated statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If thepremium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a loss (and related liability) is recorded for the excess deficiency.\nShort Duration Contracts\nAcquisition costs relating to extended service contracts, vehicle service contracts, mobile device protection, credit insurance, lender-placed homeownersinsurance and flood, multifamily housing and manufactured housing insurance are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Theseacquisition costs consist primarily of advance commissions paid to agents.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives with amaximum of 39.5 years for buildings, a maximum of seven years for furniture and a maximum of five years for equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairsare charged to income as incurred.

The Company performs the annual goodwillimpairment test as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors,an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flowsdue to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business forwhich discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can beaggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAt the time of the annual goodwill test, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform aquantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company is required to perform an additional quantitative step if it determines qualitatively that it is more likely than not(likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Otherwise, no further testing isrequired. \nIf the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than the carrying value, or otherwise elects to perform thequantitative testing, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its net book value. If the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceedsits net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the reporting unit\u2019s net book value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will berecognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.Refer to Note 15 for further details on goodwill impairment testing for 2023.\nOther Intangible Assets \nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the intangible asset is consumed, which maybe other than straight-line. Estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are required to be reassessed on at least an annual basis. For intangible assets with finitelives, impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the other intangible asset. Generally, other intangible assetswith finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment (\u201ctriggers\u201d) identified. Triggers include a significant adverse change in the extent,manner or length of time in which the intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect thevalue of the other intangible asset.\nVOBA represents the value of expected future profits in unearned premium for insurance contracts acquired in an acquisition. For vehicle service contracts andextended service contracts, such as those purchased in connection with the TWG acquisition, the amount is determined using estimates, for premium earningspatterns, paid loss development patterns, expense loads and discount rates applied to cash flows that include a provision for credit risk. The amount determinedrepresents the purchase price paid to the seller for producing the business. For vehicle service contracts and extended service contracts, VOBA is amortized consistentwith the premium earning patterns of the underlying in-force contracts. VOBA is tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for recoverability.\nAmortization expense and impairment charges for other intangible assets are included in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in theconsolidated statements of operations. \nOther Assets \nOther assets include prepaid items, income tax receivable, deferred income tax assets, right-of-use assets, dealer loans and inventory associated with theCompany\u2019s mobile protection business.  \nReserves \nReserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future premium and claim payments. Factors used intheir calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments, expected future premiums and actuarial assumptions. Calculations incorporateassumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investmentearnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. The estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is usinghistorical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes.\nF-13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5499, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c43f560-4ce3-426c-b04a-b5c078c6bba5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c43f560-4ce3-426c-b04a-b5c078c6bba5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6fbf658-590a-4d5b-ad08-381c38ad7b9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "2b6cf06b3ee79c538a4d1dd702a1054da44a62d6c23514d5cf711738e9348210", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b54f5ca4-47f5-4e45-bfbf-6a56e44fc99e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "782c98c0906eecb60826dca3c60ebd8752ecc6b0ee17d57aa43f333ede244395", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The recorded reserves represent the Company\u2019s best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group ofclaims based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation.

The difference between the updated future policy benefits and expenses reserveopening period and previous ending period due to updating the NPR is presented as a remeasurement gain or loss (e.g., a cumulative catch-up adjustment) inpolicyholder benefits in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nA remeasurement of the ending reporting period future policy benefits and expenses reserve is calculated using the current upper medium grade fixed-income corporate bond instrument yield as of the consolidated balance sheet ending period (the \u201ccurrent discount rate\u201d). The current discount rate used is anexternally published US corporate A index weighted average spot rate that is updated quarterly and effectively matches the duration of the expected cash flow streamsof the long-term care reserves. The difference between the ending period future policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the original discount rate and thefuture policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the current discount rate is recorded in AOCI in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income.\nThe long-term care insurance contracts are fully reinsured and there is no impact to consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity or net income as the reserves are fullyreinsured. See Note 17 for additional information.\nFuture policy benefits and expense reserves for universal life insurance policies consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges thatare being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy accountbalances and interest credited to policy account balances.\nShort Duration Contracts \nThe Company\u2019s short duration contracts include products and services in the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments, and Assurant Employee Benefitspolicies fully covered by reinsurance and certain medical policies no longer offered. For Global Lifestyle, the main product lines include extended service contracts,vehicle services contracts, mobile device protection and credit insurance. The main product lines for Global Housing include lender-placed homeowners and flood,Multifamily Housing and manufactured housing. For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. Theliability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claimsas of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to theCompany as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Factors used in the calculationinclude experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and expected loss ratios.\nThe Company has exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from its participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971through 1985. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that the Company discontinued writing many years ago. The Company carries case reserves forthese liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and IBNR reserves. Estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation anduncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for determining theexposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, thedetermination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.\nChanges in the estimated liabilities are recorded as a charge or credit to policyholder benefits as estimates are updated. Fees paid by the National FloodInsurance Program for processing and adjudication services are reported as a reduction of underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDebt \nThe Company reports debt net of acquisition costs, unamortized discount or premium and repurchases. Interest expense related to debt is expensed as incurred.See Note 19 for additional information.\nContingencies \nA loss contingency is recorded if reasonably estimable and probable. The Company establishes reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or if no oneestimated amount within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimatedrange. Contingencies affecting the Company primarily relate to legal and regulatory matters, which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significantchanges.\nF-15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5025, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31973d61-c23e-4cec-8298-bafe92b2f6ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "31973d61-c23e-4cec-8298-bafe92b2f6ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d7ce342-1dca-485e-82e1-271ba88d18c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "62720be5f85af6dd80590c7158b2d5041cfc0bb78ec79cbcf0ee15d5bd00172a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Other Liabilities\nWith respect to the deductible portion of a high deductible claim, the Company manages and pays the entire claim on behalf of the insured and is reimbursed bythe insured for the deductible portion of the claim. These recoverable amounts represent a credit exposure. The Company accounts for credit losses using theexpected credit loss model for high deductible recoverables. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating theallowance, whereby the credit ratings of insureds are used in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for unsecured portion of the highdeductible recoverables on unpaid future policy benefits. The methodology used by the Company incorporates historical default factors for each insured based ontheir credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. The allowance is based upon the Company\u2019s ongoing review of amountsoutstanding, length of collection periods, changes in insured credit standing and other relevant factors.\nRetirement of Treasury Stock\nThe Company accounts for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method. This method of accounting allocates the cost of repurchased andretired shares between paid-in capital and retained earnings by comparing the price of shares repurchased to the original issue proceeds of those shares. When therepurchase price of the shares is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. The Company uses an average cost method todetermine the cost of the repurchased shares to be retired.\nPremiums \nShort Duration Contracts \nThe Company\u2019s short duration contracts revenue is recognized over the contract term in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.\nPremiums revenue from vehicle and extended service contracts are earned over the term of the contract, which are typically between three and five years, basedon loss emergence experience. Mobile device protection and credit insurance are monthly policies and premium is earned on a monthly basis.\nPremiums for lender-placed homeowners and flood insurance, Multifamily Housing, manufactured housing, are generally earned on a pro-rata basis over theterm of the policies, which are typically over twelve months.\nReinsurance reinstatement premiums are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premium and are netted against netearned premiums in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLong Duration Contracts \nPremiums for the Company\u2019s run-off blocks of long-term care insurance contracts are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal lifeinsurance, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. These premiums are ceded. \nFees and Other Income \nThe Company derives fees and other income from providing administrative services, mobile-related services and mortgage property risk management services.These fees are recognized as the services are performed. \nThe Company reports revenues related to long duration and short duration insurance contracts as premiums, including insurance contracts written by non-insurance affiliates, such as certain extended service contracts, consistent with the Company\u2019s principal business of insurance. Components of consideration paid bythe insured are generally not separated as fees and other income. However, when a component of the consideration paid by an insured both does not involve fulfillingthe insurance obligation (in that it does not involve acquisition, claims or other administrative aspects of the insurance contract) and the related service could havebeen written as a separate contract, it is reported in fees and other income.\nDealer obligor service contracts are sales in which an unaffiliated retailer/dealer is the obligor and the Company provides administrative services only. For thesecontract sales, the Company recognizes administrative fee revenue on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the service contract which correspond to the period in whichthe services are performed.\nThe unexpired portion of fee revenues are deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts. These unexpired amounts are reported in accounts payable andother liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n Underwriting, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses \nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, salaries and personnel benefits andother general operating expenses and are expensed as incurred. \nF-16", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4643, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4958dd85-e63a-4288-b8d8-8a36573c3573": {"__data__": {"id_": "4958dd85-e63a-4288-b8d8-8a36573c3573", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67657160-d0ad-45d9-93bf-5b0524e6568d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "a4d1d8ddff2ab231bbffa3b164d7861c83665231b4886f2d1fd6774113b27353", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Income Taxes\nCurrent federal income taxes are recognized based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted taxlaws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the Company expects the temporary differences to reverse. A valuation allowance is established fordeferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. The impact of changes in tax rates on all deferred tax assets and liabilities arerequired to be reflected within income on the enactment date, regardless of the financial statement component where the deferred tax originated.\nThe Company classifies net interest expense related to tax matters and any applicable penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutedearnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that can be converted into common stock were exercised asof the end of the period, if dilutive.

The Company is exposed to the credit risk of reinsurers, as the Company remains liable to insureds regardless of whether related reinsurance recoverablesare collected. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, reinsurance recoverables totaled $6.65 billion and $7.00 billion, respectively, the majority of which are protectedfrom credit risk by various types of collateral or other risk mitigation mechanisms, such as trusts, letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modifiedcoinsurance or funds withheld arrangement.\nThe Company utilizes external credit ratings published by S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., at the balance sheet date when determining theallowance. Where rates are not available, the Company assigns default credit ratings based on if the reinsurer is authorized or unauthorized. Of the total recoverablessubject to the allowance, 82% were rated A- or better, 1% were rated BBB or BB and 17% were not rated based on the Company\u2019s analysis and assigned ratings forthe year ended December 31, 2023; and 77% were rated A- or better, 3% were rated BBB or BB, and 20% were not rated based on the Company\u2019s analysis andassigned ratings for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table presents the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for reinsurance recoverables for the periods indicated:\nGlobal Lifestyle Global Housing Corporateand Other Total\nBalance, December 31, 2021 $ 3.6 $ 0.9 $ 0.5 $ 5.0 Current period change for credit losses \u2014 0.2 0.2 0.4 \nBalance, December 31, 2022 3.6 1.1 0.7 5.4 \nCurrent period change for credit losses (0.3) \u2014 (0.3) (0.6)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 3.3 $ 1.1 $ 0.4 $ 4.8 \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the current period change for credit losses was $(0.6) million and $0.4 million, respectively. The decrease in2023 was primarily due to an increase in collateral held as security under the reinsurance agreements and a reduction in ceded reserves for unsecured reinsurers underthe reinsurance agreements. When determining the allowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not increase default probabilities by reinsurersince there had been no credit rating downgrades or major negative credit indications of the Company\u2019s reinsurers that has impacted rating. The allowance may beincreased and income reduced in future periods if there are future ratings downgrades or other measurable information supporting an increase in reinsurer defaultprobabilities, including collateral reductions.\nPremium and Accounts Receivables\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk from premiums and other accounts receivables. For premiums receivable, the exposure to loss upon a default is oftenmitigated by the ability to terminate the policy on default and offset the corresponding unearned premium liability. The Company has other mitigating offsets fromamounts payable on commissions and profit share arrangements when the counterparty to the receivable is a sponsor/agent of the Company\u2019s insurance product.\nF-21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3730, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bf28653-488b-4047-b16e-77e6e0f98cb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bf28653-488b-4047-b16e-77e6e0f98cb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59ebb682-7578-4308-9d57-286ad1cf03ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "8a6f5f5839ec17ab4049179e2f664f5a478e8efb9e8872e3fb56697a52b5c51d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The following table presents the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for premium and accounts receivables for the periods indicated:\nGlobal Lifestyle Global Housing Corporateand Other Total\nBalance, December 31, 2021 $ 6.9 $ 2.4 $ 0.1 $ 9.4 Current period change for credit losses (0.2) 0.1 2.1 2.0 \nWrite-offs (0.7) (0.3) (1.0) (2.0)\nForeign currency translation (0.2) \u2014 \u2014 (0.2)\nBalance, December 31, 2022 5.8 2.2 1.2 9.2 \nCurrent period change for credit losses 2.3 1.1 0.4 3.8 Recoveries (0.3) \u2014 \u2014 (0.3)\nWrite-offs (1.5) (0.9) (1.2) (3.6)\nForeign currency translation (0.1) \u2014 \u2014 (0.1)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 6.2 $ 2.4 $ 0.4 $ 9.0 \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the current period change for credit losses was $3.8 million, primarily due to an increase in Global Lifestyle acrossvarious products.

The increase in2023 was primarily driven by changes in certain key credit quality indicators.

Refer to Note 2 for additional information on highdeductible recoverables.\n6. Segment Information\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had two reportable operating segments: Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. In addition, the Company reports theCorporate and Other segment, which includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA,the segment measure of profitability, as net income from continuing operations, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equitysecurities, non-core operations (defined below), restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost managementactivities), Assurant Health runoff operations (described below), interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization ofpurchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company realigned the composition of its reportable operating segments to correspond with changes to its operating structure. Asa result, the Global Housing segment is now comprised of two key lines of business: Homeowners, and Renters and Other. Certain specialty products, mainly thecommercial equipment business, previously reported in the Global Housing segment are now reported in Global Lifestyle to better align with the Company\u2019s go-to-market strategy.

Contract Revenues\nThe Company partners with clients to provide consumers with a diverse range of protection products and services. The Company\u2019s revenues from protectionproducts are accounted for as insurance contracts and are recognized over the term of the insurance protection provided. Revenues from service contracts and sales ofproducts are recognized as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied or the products are delivered. Revenue is measured as the amount of considerationthe Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for performing the services or transferring products. If payments are received before the related revenue isrecognized, the amount is recorded as unearned revenue or advance payment liabilities, until the performance obligations are satisfied or the products are transferred.\nThe disaggregated revenues from service contracts included in fees and other income on the consolidated statements of operations are $1.16 billion,$1.09 billion and $1.01 billion for Global Lifestyle and $84.3 million, $82.9 million and $94.3 million for Global Housing for the years ended December 31, 2023,2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGlobal Lifestyle\nIn the Global Lifestyle segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Company\u2019s Connected Living business. Throughpartnerships with mobile service providers, the Company provides administrative services related to its mobile device protection products, including program designand marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain and service delivery, repair and logistics, and devicedisposition. Administrative fees are generally billed monthly based on the volume of services provided during the billing period (for example, based on the number ofmobile subscribers) with payment due within a short-term period.

Fair Value Disclosures\nFair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures\n The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the pricethat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company hascategorized its recurring fair value basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuationtechnique.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority tounobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair valuehierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement in its entirety. The Company\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment andtakes into account factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n\u2022 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.\n\u2022 Level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantiallythe full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical orsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset or liability.The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset or liability.\n\u2022 Level 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any,market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect management\u2019s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use inpricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassificationof levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables present the Company\u2019s fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023and 2022. The amounts presented below for short-term investments, other investments, cash equivalents, other assets, assets held in and liabilities related to separateaccounts and other liabilities differ from the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets because only certain investments or certain assets and liabilitieswithin these line items are measured at estimated fair value. Other investments are comprised of investments in the AIP, the ASIC plan, and the ADC and otherderivatives. Other liabilities are comprised of investments in the AIP, contingent considerations related to business combinations and other derivatives. The fair valueamount and the majority of the associated levels presented for other investments and assets and liabilities held in separate accounts are received directly from thirdparties.\nF-32", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3703, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbbd75f4-f694-491e-b0ed-fa03116fef38": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbbd75f4-f694-491e-b0ed-fa03116fef38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "AIZ 10K -

The threevaluation techniques described in the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance are consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies.\nThe market approach valuation techniques use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assetsor liabilities. When possible, quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets are used as of the period-end date (such as for mutual funds and money market funds).Otherwise, the Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market approach including matrix pricing and comparables. Matrix pricing is a mathematicaltechnique employed principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for those securities but, rather, relying on the securities\u2019relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Market approach valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables. Multiplesmight lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment,considering both qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement.\nIncome approach valuation techniques convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. Thesetechniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts as of the period-end date. Examples of income approach valuation techniques include present valuetechniques, option-pricing models, binomial or lattice models that incorporate present value techniques and the multi-period excess earnings method.\nCost approach valuation techniques are based upon the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset at the period-end date, or thecurrent replacement cost. That is, from the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost toa market participant (buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.\nWhile not all three approaches are applicable to all financial assets or liabilities, where appropriate, the Company may use one or more valuation techniques.For all the classes of financial assets and liabilities included in the above hierarchy, excluding certain derivatives and certain privately placed corporate bonds, theCompany generally uses the market valuation technique.\nLevel 1 Securities\nThe Company\u2019s investments and liabilities classified as Level 1 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of mutual funds and related obligations, moneymarket funds and common stocks that are publicly listed and/or actively traded in an established market.\nLevel 2 Securities\nThe Company values Level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing service or asset manager. They prepare estimates of fairvalue measurements for the Company\u2019s Level 2 securities using proprietary valuation models based on techniques such as matrix pricing which include observablemarket inputs.

The extent of the use of each observable market input for a security depends on the type of security and themarket conditions at the balance sheet date. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of observable market inputs may change as some observable marketinputs may not be relevant or additional inputs may be necessary. The Company uses the following observable market inputs (\u201cstandard inputs\u201d), listed in theapproximate order of priority, in the pricing evaluation of Level 2 securities: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sidedmarkets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research data.

Additionally, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities utilize new issue data while residential mortgage-backedsecurities utilize vendor trading platform data.\nU.S. and foreign corporate: Corporate securities are priced by the Company\u2019s pricing service using standard inputs. Non-investment grade securities within thiscategory are priced by the Company\u2019s pricing service and asset managers using observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer in additionto the standard inputs. Certain privately placed corporate bonds are priced by a non-pricing service source using a model with observable inputs including the creditrating, credit spreads, sector add-ons, and issuer specific add-ons. \nNon-redeemable preferred stocks: Non-redeemable preferred stocks are priced by the Company\u2019s pricing service using observations of equity and credit defaultswap curves related to the issuer in addition to the standard inputs.\nShort-term investments, cash equivalents, assets held in separate accounts and liabilities related to separate accounts: To price the fixed maturity securitiesand related obligations in these categories, the pricing service utilizes the standard inputs.\nOther liabilities: Foreign exchange forwards are priced using a pricing model which utilizes market observable inputs including foreign exchange spot rate,forward points and date to settlement.\nValuation models used by the pricing service can change from period to period, depending on the appropriate observable inputs that are available at the balancesheet date to price a security.\nLevel 3 Securities\nThe Company\u2019s investments classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of $125.5 million and $96.6 million of fixed maturity securities.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced using non-binding third-party quotes, for which the underlying quantitative inputsare not developed by the Company and are not readily available or observable.\nOther investments and other liabilities: The Company prices swaptions using a Black-Scholes pricing model incorporating third-party market data, includingswap volatility data.\nOther assets: The Company prices options using non-binding quotes provided by market makers or broker dealers who are recognized as market participants.Inputs factored into the non-binding quotes include trades in the actual option which is being priced, deal structure, spot rates, volatility, and projected cashflows.\nF-36", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4745, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dc41072-ebc0-47df-9dee-7778c0cbc089": {"__data__": {"id_": "1dc41072-ebc0-47df-9dee-7778c0cbc089", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1160fa63-bcb1-4eec-b7dc-38bc4360c273", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "f547f5ff854561eea4010349cb321c949283a03d7ccb496a458fefe627525a3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Inputs may include future business performance, earn out caps,and applicable discount rates.\nManagement evaluates the following factors in order to determine whether the market for a financial asset is inactive.

The Company performs a periodic analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent areasonable estimate of the financial assets\u2019 fair values. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accountingprofessionals. Examples of procedures performed include initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricingservice, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness.Following this analysis, the Company generally uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. On infrequent occasions, a non-pricing servicesource may be more familiar with the market activity for a particular security than the pricing service. In these cases the price used is taken from the non-pricingservice source. The pricing service provides information to indicate which securities were priced using market observable inputs so that the Company can properlycategorize the Company\u2019s financial assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nDisclosures for Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company also measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, generally on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying amount of the assets may be affected. These assets include commercial mortgage loans, equity investments accounted for under the measurementalternative, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets.\nIn 2023 and 2022, as a result of third-party market observable transactions that were of the same issuer and determined to be similar, the Company markedcertain of its equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative to fair value. The carrying value of investments under the measurement alternativemarked to fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.3 million and $40.8 million, respectively. Given the significant unobservableinputs involved in valuation of these investments, they are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, these valuations utilize the market approach, oran option pricing model backsolve method, which is a valuation approach that can be used to determine the value of common shares for companies with complexcapital structures in which there have not been any recent transactions involving common shares. Inputs include capitalization tables, investment past and futureperformance projections, time to exit, discount rate and volatility based upon an appropriate industry group. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Companyrecorded fair value increases of $0.6 million related to one market observable transaction and a note conversion of two investments. For the year ended December 31,2022, the Company recorded fair value increases of $19.5 million related to three market observable transactions of three investments.\nIn 2023 and 2022, as a result of a qualitative analysis indicating an impairment existed, the Company performed a quantitative analysis utilizing a probabilityweighted scenario model and determined certain investments were impaired. Model inputs include capitalization tables, investment past and future companyperformance projections, and discount rate. Based upon model outputs, impairments of $12.9 million and $3.0 million were recorded for the years ended December31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRefer to Note 15 for the results of the 2023 goodwill impairment testing.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments Disclosures\nThe financial instruments guidance requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate such fairvalue. Therefore, it requires fair value disclosure for financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.However, this guidance excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts and those accounted for under the equity method (suchas partnerships).\nF-37", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4973, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "468a4a84-da6a-4d0f-9aef-2a655b08666d": {"__data__": {"id_": "468a4a84-da6a-4d0f-9aef-2a655b08666d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f8551ef-012b-4cb3-8557-6d4e401ec6b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "4a926694b1f386ef93edfd5f24eb9470cb9cde81818783a7f05009cf8a63b9ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For the financial instruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying value in the consolidated balance sheets equalsor approximates fair value.

The estimated fair value of each reporting unit represented the sum of thediscounted cash flows and terminal value.\nA Guideline Company Method, in which we identified a group of peer companies that have similar operations to the reporting unit, was used; however, directpeer comparisons for the reporting units were limited given the diversity of the products and services within the businesses. This method was used to value eachreporting unit based upon its relative performance to peer companies, based on several measures, including price to trailing 12-month earnings, price to projectedearnings, price to tangible net worth and return on equity.\nWhile DDM and Guideline Company valuation methodologies were considered in assessing fair value, the DDM was weighted more heavily since managementbelieves that expected cash flows are the most important factor in the valuation of a business enterprise, and also considering the lack of directly-comparable peercompanies.

Reserves\nShort Duration Contracts\nContinuing Business (Global Lifestyle and Global Housing)\nThe Company\u2019s short duration contracts include products and services within the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments. The main product lines forGlobal Lifestyle include mobile device protection, extended service contracts for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance. The mainproduct lines for Global Housing include lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance; voluntary manufactured housing, condominium andhomeowners insurance; and renters insurance.\nTotal IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case basis incurred losses from the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates. Ultimate loss andloss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. The reserving methods employed by the Company include theChain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Reportable catastrophe losses are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequencyand severity approach. The methods involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each productgrouping. As the data ages, loss development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting lossdevelopment factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The underlying premiseof the Chain Ladder method is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method employs acombination of past claims development and an estimate of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. The Munich Chain Ladder method takes into account thecorrelations between paid and incurred development in projecting future development factors and is typically more applicable to products experiencing greatervariability in incurred to paid ratios.\nThe best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense is generally selected from a blend of the different methods that are applied consistently eachperiod considering significant assumptions, including projected loss development factors and expected loss ratios. There have been no significant changes in themethodologies and assumptions utilized in estimating the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for any of the periods presented.\nNon-core Operations\nShort duration contracts in non-core operations consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within Global Housing.While the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tail compared toproperty coverages which make up most of the Company\u2019s core operations.\nThe reserving methodology described for continuing short duration business is applicable for non-core operations. Given the nature of commercial liabilitycoverages and its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on social inflation impacts and analysis of individual case reserve adequacy onknown claims. This is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include allowance for future inflation impacts, detailed open claim inventory analysis,and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement the Company\u2019s own historical claims experience.\nDisposed and Runoff Short Duration Insurance Lines\nShort duration contracts within the disposed business include certain medical policies no longer offered and Assurant Employee Benefits policies disposed ofvia reinsurance. Reserves and reinsurance recoverables for previously disposed business are included in the consolidated balance sheets.

Under the modified retrospective method, the long-term care insurance contracts are grouped into cohorts basedon the contract\u2019s issue year. Premium deficiency reserves are allocated proportional to the cohort\u2019s reserve balance as of the transition date of December 31, 2020. Atthe cohort level, the NPR calculation is performed, and the unlocking of the NPR for cohorts in excess of 100% is recognized through opening retained earnings.

The tables provide undiscounted information about claims development by accident year for the significant short durationclaims and benefits payable balances.\nThe following factors are relevant to the loss development information included in the tables below:\n\u2022 Table Presentation: The tables are organized by accident year. For certain categories of claims and for reinsurance recoverables, losses may sometimes bereclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. These reclassifications are shownas development in the respective years in the tables below. Predominantly, the Company writes short-tail lines that are written on an occurrence basis. Fiveyears of claims development information is provided since most of the claims are fully developed after five years, as shown in the average payout ratiotables.\n\u2022 Table Groupings: The groupings have homogeneous risk characteristics with similar development patterns and would generally be subject to similar trendsand reflect our reportable segments.\n\u2022 Impact of Reinsurance: The reinsurance program varies by exposure type. Historically, the Company has leveraged facultative and treaty reinsurance, bothon pro-rata and excess of loss basis. The reinsurance program may change from year to year, which may affect the comparability of the data presented in thetables.\n\u2022 IBNR: Includes development from past reported losses in IBNR.\n\u2022 Information excluded from tables: Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are excluded from the tables.\n\u2022 Foreign exchange rates: The loss development for operations outside of the U.S. is presented for all accident years using the current exchange rates atDecember 31, 2023. Although this approach requires restating all prior accident year information, the changes in exchange rates do not impact incurred andpaid loss development trends.\n\u2022 Acquisitions: Includes acquisitions from all accident years presented in the tables.

Many of these contracts and products contain retrospective commission(profit sharing) provisions that would result in offsetting increases or decreases in expense dependent on if the development was favorable or unfavorable.  \nDevelopment from Global Lifestyle is attributable to nearly all lines of business across most of the Company\u2019s regions with a concentration on more recentaccident years and based on emerging evaluations regarding loss experience each period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Global Lifestyle net favorabledevelopment of $23.6 million was attributable to Connected Living which contributed $26.2 million comprised of $14.7 million from credit and other insurance,$6.0 million from mobile and $5.5 million from extended service contracts. The favorable development from credit and other insurance was primarily due tofavorable runoff of credit products in Europe and from Canada credit and travel programs where loss assumptions related to inflation and COVID-19 did notmaterialize. For extended service contracts, improving data maturity on a large client resulted in favorable reserve refinements. Global Automotive experienced netunfavorable development of $2.7 million, driven by inflationary impacts on parts and labor costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Global Lifestyle netfavorable development was primarily attributable to reserve releases in Global Automotive ancillary products due to the strong used vehicle market. For the yearended December 31, 2021, the release of reserves associated with potential COVID-19-related claims that have not materialized was a contributing factor.\nForeign exchange rate movements over time caused some of the reserve differences shown in the reserve roll forward and prior year incurred loss tables to varyfrom what is reflected in the claims development tables for Global Lifestyle. The impacts by year were $0.3 million, $(0.4) million, and $(0.7) million for the yearsended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company has entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events.\nSegment Client Risk and Profit Sharing\nThe Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments write business produced by their clients, such as mobile providers, auto dealers, mortgage lenders andservicers, and financial institutions, and reinsure all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of some clients. Such arrangements allow significantflexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business.\nA substantial portion of Global Lifestyle\u2019s and Global Housing\u2019s reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risks related tobusiness generated by certain clients to the clients\u2019 own captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest.Through these arrangements, the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client-generated business. When the reinsurancecompanies are not authorized to do business in the state of domicile of the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiary, the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiary generally obtainscollateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full statutoryfinancial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance.\nBusiness Divestitures\nThe Company has used reinsurance to sell certain businesses in the past because the businesses shared legal entities with operating segments that the Companyretained. Assets backing reserves reinsured under these sales are mainly held in trusts or separate accounts. If the reinsurers became insolvent, the Company would beexposed to the risk that the assets in the trusts or the separate accounts, if any, could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert back to theCompany. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these divestitures amounted to $599.7 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $416.0 million was attributableto John Hancock, which reinsures the long-term care business and has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A+ with a stable outlook.\nIn addition, the Company would be responsible for administering these businesses in the event of reinsurer insolvency. The Company does not currently havethe administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. Accordingly, the Company would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of aninsolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. The Company might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resultingmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any regulatory actions taken with respect to the solvency of the insurance subsidiaries of JohnHancock and the Company has not been obligated to fulfill any of its obligations. John Hancock has paid its obligations when due and there have been no disputes.\nF-56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3663, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c14dd04-14e7-4b19-b5d9-5e637bcf3148": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c14dd04-14e7-4b19-b5d9-5e637bcf3148", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3815abf-a947-4964-9db1-bba158c63540", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "995e92c2e8b38eefb00dbb72f3e9b7e13282a72cd0196a19be385f976de9f225", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c58c6c83-46ee-40cb-9672-802da31eb130", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d31701bda332ff64302d52af3e3263ec357333ba20ae6e337f3ebcd3e39febd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "19.

Statutory Information\nThe Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries prepare financial statements in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles (\u201cSAP\u201d) prescribed or permitted by theinsurance departments of their states of domicile. Prescribed SAP includes the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) as well as state laws, regulations and administrative rules.\nThe principal differences between SAP and GAAP are: (1) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, but are deferred and amortized underGAAP; (2) VOBA is not capitalized under SAP but is under GAAP; (3) the classification and carrying amounts of investments in certain securities are different underSAP than under GAAP; (4) the criteria for providing asset valuation allowances, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are different underSAP than under GAAP; (5) the timing of establishing certain reserves, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are different under SAP thanunder GAAP; (6) certain assets are not admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP; (7) methodologies used to determine the amounts of deferred taxes,intangible assets and goodwill are different under SAP than under GAAP; and (8) the criteria for obtaining reinsurance accounting treatment is different under SAPthan under GAAP, and SAP allows net presentation of insurance reserves and reinsurance recoverables.\nThe combined statutory net income, excluding intercompany dividends and surplus note interest, and capital and surplus of the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciledstatutory insurance subsidiaries is as follows: \n Years Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\nProperty and casualty companies $ 529.4 $ 283.5 $ 468.0 \nLife and health companies 13.7 20.0 18.6 \nTotal statutory net income $ 543.1 $ 303.5 $ 486.6 \n December 31,\n 2023 2022\nProperty and casualty companies $ 1,461.4 $ 1,472.2 Life and health companies 87.6 80.2 \nTotal statutory capital and surplus $ 1,549.0 $ 1,552.4 \nThe Company also has non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries that are not subject to SAP. The statutory net income and statutory capitaland surplus amounts presented above do not include non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries in accordance with SAP.\nInsurance enterprises are required by state insurance departments to adhere to minimum risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) requirements developed by the NAIC. TheCompany\u2019s insurance subsidiaries expect to exceed minimum RBC requirements as of December 31, 2023. In addition, all of our rated insurance subsidiariescurrently maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A.\nThe payment of dividends to the Company by any of the Company\u2019s regulated U.S domiciled insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e.,extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatoryapproval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of the jurisdictions inwhich the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year\u2019s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Somejurisdictions limit ordinary dividends to the greater of these two amounts, others limit them to the lesser of these two amounts and some jurisdictions exclude prioryear realized capital gains from prior year net income in determining ordinary dividend capacity. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends mayonly be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by the Company\u2019s insurancesubsidiaries to the Company (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders orcreditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable lawsand regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay to the Company in 2024 without regulatoryapproval is approximately $592.4 million. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of the Company\u2019sinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.\nF-66", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4509, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ecd69f5-a82d-45d6-8d9d-4a3df33f9ff8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ecd69f5-a82d-45d6-8d9d-4a3df33f9ff8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "140", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111c603f-5d51-4fb3-b6ca-7f3c24c645b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "140", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1948738, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "ad9d591a94765e80ed357854ae74fd255af7b814a9f155cf7919a302cf40ca1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "24. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (\u201cAssurant Pension Plan\u201d) covering substantially allemployees. The Assurant Pension Plan is considered \u201cqualified\u201d because it meets the requirements of IRC Section 401(a) (\u201cIRC 401(a)\u201d) and the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). The Assurant Pension Plan is a pension equity plan with a grandfathered final average earningsplan for a certain group of employees. Benefits are based on certain years of service and the employee\u2019s compensation during certain such years of service. TheCompany\u2019s funding policy is to contribute amounts to the Assurant Pension Plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements in ERISA, plus suchadditional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time up to the maximum permitted. The funding policy considers several factors todetermine such additional amounts, including items such as the amount of service cost plus 15% of the Assurant Pension Plan deficit and the capital position of theCompany. During the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan. Due to the Assurant Pension Plan\u2019s current fundingstatus, no contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan are expected during the year ending December 31, 2024. Assurant Pension Plan assets are maintained in aseparate trust. Assurant Pension Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company also has various non-contributory, non-qualified supplemental plans covering certain employees including the Assurant Executive Pension Planand the Assurant Supplement Executive Retirement Plan (the \u201cSERP\u201d). Since these plans are \u201cnon-qualified\u201d they are not subject to the requirements of IRC 401(a)and ERISA. As such, the Company is not required, and does not, fund these plans. The qualified and non-qualified plans are referred to as \u201cPension Benefits\u201d unlessotherwise noted. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these benefits; however, the Company will not be relieved of its obligation to plan participants fortheir vested benefits.\nIn addition, the Company provides certain life and health care benefits (\u201cRetirement Health Benefits\u201d) for retired employees and their dependents. On July 1,2011, the Company terminated certain health care benefits for employees who did not qualify for \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status and no longer offers these benefits to newhires. The Company contribution, plan design and other terms of the remaining benefits did not change for those grandfathered employees. The Company has theright to modify or terminate these benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2014, the Pension Benefits plans were closed to new hires. Effective March 1, 2016, the Pension Benefits and Retirement Health Benefits(together, the \u201cPlans\u201d) were amended such that no additional benefits will be earned after February 29, 2016.\nIn February 2020, the Company amended the Retirement Health Benefits to terminate effective December 31, 2024 (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d). Benefits will bepaid up to the Termination Date. The Retirement Health Benefits obligations were remeasured using a discount rate of 1.55%, selected based on a cash flow analysisusing a bond yield curve as of February 29, 2020, and the fair market value of the Retirement Health Benefits assets as of February 29, 2020. The remeasurementresulted in a reduction to the Retirement Health Benefits obligations of $65.6 million and a corresponding prior service credit in AOCI, which will be reclassifiedfrom AOCI as it is amortized in the net periodic benefit cost over the remaining period until the Termination Date.\nF-67", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3789, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5dd2592-d00d-4cb4-9e12-9ad60a39bde4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5dd2592-d00d-4cb4-9e12-9ad60a39bde4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "AIZ 10K -

The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to beinvested. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the targeted asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assetassumptions for the portfolio. The Company believes the current assumption reflects the projected return on the invested assets, given the current market conditionsand the modified portfolio structure. Actual return (loss) on Plan assets was 5.6%, (16.9)% and 2.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021respectively.\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost were as follows: \n Retirement Health Benefits\n 2023 2022 2021\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year:Pre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan 5.6% 5.4% 5.5%\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical) 4.0% 4.2% 4.1%Post-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Rx) 7.0% 6.6% 6.9%Pre-65 Reimbursement Plan 5.5% 5.4% 5.4%\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan 5.5% 5.4% 5.4%Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 4.0% 4.0% 4.0%Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\nPre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan 2045 2045 2045Post-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical & Rx) 2045 2045 2045Pre-65 Reimbursement Plan 2045 2045 2045\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan 2045 2045 2045\nThe assets of the Plans are managed to maximize their long-term pre-tax investment return, subject to the following dual constraints: minimization of requiredcontributions and maintenance of solvency requirements. It is anticipated that periodic contributions to the Plans will, for the foreseeable future, be sufficient to meetbenefit payments thus allowing the balance to be managed according to a long-term approach. The Benefit Plans Investment Committee (\u201cBPIC\u201d) for the Plans meetson a quarterly basis and reviews the re-balancing of existing fund assets and the asset allocation of new fund contributions.\nThe goal of the Company\u2019s asset strategy is to ensure that the growth in the value of the Plans\u2019 assets over the long-term, both in real and nominal terms,manages (controls) risk exposure. Risk is managed by investing in a broad range of asset classes, and within those asset classes, a broad range of individualsecurities. Diversification by asset classes stabilizes total results over short-term time periods. Each asset class is externally managed by outside investment managersappointed by the BPIC. Derivatives may be used consistent with the Plans\u2019 investment objectives established by the BPIC. All securities must be U.S. Dollardenominated.\nThe BPIC oversees the investment of the Plans\u2019 assets and periodically reviews the investment strategies, strategic asset allocation, liabilities and portfoliostructure of the assets. After a 2017 review and considering the funded status of the Assurant Pension Plan, the BPIC transitioned plan assets to a new target assetallocation consisting of 80% fixed income, 10% real estate, 5% hedge funds and 5% equities.\nThe assets of the Plans are primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Interest rate risk is hedged by aligning the duration of the fixed maturity securitieswith the duration of the liabilities. Specifically, interest rate swaps can be used if needed to synthetically extend the duration of fixed maturity securities to match theduration of the liabilities, as measured on a projected benefit obligation basis. In addition, the Plans\u2019 fixed income securities have exposure to credit risk.

(\u201cCompany\u201d) has been adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board ofDirectors (\u201cthe Board\u201d) on November 8, 2023 and is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended(\u201cExchange Act\u201d), including Rule 10D-1 (\u201cRule 10D-1\u201d), as well as Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) Listed CompanyManual (\u201cSection 303A.14\u201d). Capitalized terms are defined in Section 2.\n1.    Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nThis Policy will be triggered in the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. If an Accounting Restatement occurs, theCompany will promptly review the matter and, if applicable, will seek to recover from any Covered Executive who received Covered Compensationduring the three (3) fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare such Accounting Restatement (the\u201cRecoupment Period\u201d), the amount of such Covered Compensation that would not have been granted, earned or vested to the Covered Executive underthe restated financial statements (such excess amount, the \u201cErroneously Awarded Compensation\u201d). If the Financial Reporting Measure applicable to theCovered Compensation is a stock price or total shareholder return measure, then the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall bedetermined based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Company\u2019s stock price or total shareholder return uponwhich such Covered Compensation was received. The amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be calculated on a pre-tax basis.\nThis Policy applies regardless of (a) whether the Covered Executive engaged in misconduct or had any responsibility for the noncompliance withfinancial reporting requirements or (b) if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\nThere is no exception for de minimis amounts of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy,the Company is not required to recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the event that the Compensation Committee has made adetermination that recovery of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation would be impracticable because either:\n    (a) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided that, before concludingthat it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this clause (a), the Company shall have firstmade a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt to recover, and provide thatdocumentation to the NYSE; or\n    (b) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company,to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive, directly or indirectly, for any losses that such individual may incur in connection with therecovery of any Incentive Compensation as set forth in this Policy, including through the payment of insurance premiums or gross-up payments.\n2.    Definitions\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy below shall have the meanings set forth in the Amended and Restated Assurant, Inc. 2017 LongTerm Equity Incentive Plan. For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\n    (a) \u201cAccounting Restatement\u201d means an accounting restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements due to the Company\u2019s material noncompliancewith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issuedfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error werecorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. For purposes of this Policy, an Accounting Restatement shall not be deemed tooccur in the event of a restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements due to an out-of-period adjustment or a retrospective (i) application of achange in accounting principles; (ii) revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company\u2019s internal organization;(iii) reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (iv) application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities undercommon control;

These contractsprovide consumers with coverage on mobile devices and consumer electronics and appliances, protecting them from certain covered losses. We pay the cost ofrepairing or replacing these consumer goods in the event of loss, theft, accidental damage, mechanical breakdown or electronic malfunction after the manufacturer'swarranty expires. Our strategy is to provide integrated service solutions to our clients that address all aspects of the insurance or extended service contract, includingprogram design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain services, service delivery and repairand logistics management, while ensuring exceptional customer experience measured through our net promoter scores. For example, we provide end-to-end mobiledevice lifecycle solutions in our mobile business from when the device is received and inspected, repaired or refurbished, to when it is ultimately disposed of througha sale to a third-party or used to support an insurance claim. In addition to extended protection for multiple devices, our mobile offerings include trade-in andupgrade programs, premium technical support, including device self-diagnostic tools, and device disposition. We also sell repaired or refurbished mobile and otherelectronic devices, as well as provide Certified Pre-Owned (\u201cCPO\u201d) devices to our clients to fulfill their insurance and consumer needs. We provide in-store, same-day device repairs to customers through our nationwide network of over 900 repair and partner locations that support both our insurance and non-insurancecustomers. We believe that with the required administrative capability, digital platforms enabling on-boarding, claims management and service delivery, supply chainmanagement, technical support infrastructure, insurance underwriting capabilities and a variety of adjacent value-added services, like trade-in and upgrade and assetvalue recovery, we maintain a differentiated position in this marketplace.\nWithin Connected Living, our global financial services business maintains a suite of protection and assurance products that deliver a combination of featuresand benefits for varying customer segment needs.

Infourth quarter 2023, we made the decision to fully exit our operations in mainland China (other than Hong Kong), which were subsequently sold in 2024. GlobalLifestyle focuses on establishing strong, long-term relationships with clients that are leaders in their markets, including leading distributors of our products andservices. In Connected Living, we partner with mobile service providers (including carriers, retailers, OEMs and cable operators) and financial and other institutionsto market our mobile device solutions, with some of the largest OEMs, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers (including e-commerce retailers) and cableoperators to market our extended service contracts and related services, and with financial institutions, insurers and retailers to market our credit and other insuranceproducts. In Global Automotive, we partner with auto dealers and agents, third-party administrators, manufacturers, equipment retailers and large banks andfinancing companies to market our vehicle protection, commercial equipment-related products and other related services. Many of our agreements in GlobalLifestyle are exclusive and multi-year with terms generally between three and five years and allow us to integrate our administrative systems with those of ourclients.\nGlobal Lifestyle is dependent on a few clients, in particular mobile service providers, and a reduction in business with or the loss of one or more such clientscould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

While smartphone penetration in the U.S., Japanese andEuropean markets is high, other markets are less mature and present growth opportunities. Global adoption of 5G by subscribers is a high priority for mobile serviceproviders. The worldwide used and refurbished smartphone market is growing, driven by the cost and availability of new devices and sustainability-consciouscustomers.\nConsumer needs relating to mobile devices are continuing to expand in scope. We believe there are growth opportunities in bundled protection products, whichsupport customers as they take full advantage of the features and functions of their mobile devices through their daily interaction with a connected world. Expandedcapabilities like repair and logistics, technical support for customers and enhanced customer experience through digital solutions and AI allow us to create productand service offerings that customers find compelling. We believe there are additional growth opportunities in expanding protection to other devices and technologieswithin the home.\nOur business is subject to fluctuations in mobile device trade-in and upgrade volumes based on the release of new devices and carrier promotional programs, aswell as customer preferences.\nU.S. new vehicle sales have shown slight improvements from 2023 driven by increased vehicle availability and OEM incentives.

These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to thirdparties. Our inventory includes devices and parts on consignment with our nationwide network of over 900 repair and partner locations through which we provide in-store repairs. Inventory levels may vary from period to period due to, among other things, differences between actual and forecasted demand, supply chainconstraints, the addition of new devices and parts, and strategic purchases. Payment terms with clients also vary, which may result in less inventory financed byclients and more inventory financed with our own capital.\nWe take various actions to manage our inventory, including monitoring our inventory levels, managing the timing of purchases and obtaining return rights forsome programs and devices. However, the value of certain inventory could be adversely impacted by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability ofthe devices and parts, physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing, increased competition, decreased consumer demand, including due tochanges in customer preferences and changes in client promotions, supply chain constraints, growing industry emphasis on cost containment and adverse foreigntrade relationships.

Lender-placed homeowners insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance offered through ourlender-placed program. The lender-placed program provides collateral protection to lenders, mortgage servicers and investors in mortgaged properties in the eventthat a homeowner does not maintain insurance on a mortgaged dwelling. Lender-placed homeowners insurance provides structural coverage, similar to that of astandard homeowners policy. The amount of coverage is often based on the last known insurance coverage under the prior policy for the property and providesreplacement cost coverage on the property. It protects both the lender\u2019s interest and the borrower\u2019s interest and equity. We also provide real estate owned (\u201cREO\u201d)insurance, consisting of insurance on foreclosed properties managed by our clients.\nIn the majority of cases, we use proprietary insurance-tracking administration systems linked with the administrative systems of our clients to monitor clients\u2019mortgage portfolios to verify the existence of insurance on each mortgaged property and identify those that are uninsured. If there is a potential lapse in insurancecoverage, we begin a process of outreach and notification to the homeowner and the last known insurance carrier or agent through phone calls, writtencorrespondence and in some cases direct interfaces with insurance carriers, which generally takes up to 90 days to complete. If coverage cannot be verified at the endof this process, the mortgage servicer procures a lender-placed policy. The process of tracking voluntary coverage - including determining whether voluntarycoverage is in force, the policy limits in place, the perils insured and the deductibles, and obtaining other required insurance related information - is part of our riskexposure management for our lender-placed insurance business. The exposure management process is needed in order to underwrite the risk we assume, tounderstand loss exposure and to communicate with appropriate parties, including the lender, insurance agent and homeowner. Our placement rates reflect the ratio ofinsurance policies placed to tracked hazard loans. The homeowner always retains the option to obtain or renew the insurance in the voluntary insurance market.\nLender-placed manufactured housing insurance. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance formanufactured housing offered through our lender-placed program. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance is issued after an insurance tracking and exposuremanagement process similar to that described above. In most cases, tracking is performed using a proprietary insurance-tracking administration system.\nLender-placed flood insurance. Lender-placed flood insurance consists of flood insurance offered through our lender-placed program. It provides collateralprotection to lenders in mortgaged properties in the event a homeowner does not maintain required flood insurance. Lender-placed flood insurance is issued after aninsurance tracking and exposure management process similar to that described above.\nVoluntary insurance. We offer voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance. Our voluntary insurance products generally providestructural, contents and liability coverage.\nRenters and Other: We provide renters insurance and other products, as described below.\nRenters insurance. We provide integrated solutions across the resident lifecycle. We offer renters insurance for a wide variety of single and multi-family rentalproperties, providing content protection for renters\u2019 personal belongings and liability protection for the property owners against renter-caused damage. We also offeran integrated billing and tracking platform for our clients and their customers. In addition, we provide tenant bonds as an alternative to security deposits, whichallows our clients to offer a lower move-in cost option while minimizing the risk of loss from damages, and receivables management, which helps our clients tomaximize the collection of amounts owed by prior tenants.\nOther products. We are the second largest administrator for the U.S. government under the voluntary National Flood Insurance Program (the \u201cNFIP\u201d), forwhich we earn fees for collecting premiums and processing claims. This business is 100% reinsured to the U.S. government.\nDistribution and Clients\nGlobal Housing establishes long-term relationships with leading mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing lenders, property managers, andfinancial, insurance and other institutions.

We continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market and the potential impact of loan modifications, forbearances andforeclosure delays, including the impact to REO volumes. Should the housing market deteriorate for a prolonged period, we could experience a longer-term increasein our placement rates over time. In addition to the overall market, our lender-placed results are also impacted by inflation and the costs of paying claims, and themix of loans we service.\nThe U.S. renters insurance market is a growing market with new building development, high occupancy and favorable relocation trends. We believe there isopportunity to increase our market share and attachment rates with new and existing clients through our investments in digital platforms designed to deliver superiorcustomer experience and our expanded offerings to provide end-to-end solutions.\nRisk Management\nWe earn premiums on our insurance products and fees for our services. Our lender-placed insurance products are not underwritten on an individual policybasis. Contracts with our clients require us to issue these policies automatically when a borrower\u2019s insurance coverage is not maintained. These products are pricedto factor in the additional risk from ensuring that all client properties have continuous insurance coverage. We monitor pricing adequacy based on a variety of factorsand adjust pricing as required, subject to regulatory constraints, including through a built-in quarterly inflation guard feature.

Our reinsurance program generally incorporatesa provision to allow for the reinstatement of coverage, which provides protection against the risk of multiple catastrophes in a single year.\nFor our 2024 catastrophe reinsurance program, we consolidated our main reinsurance purchases into a single placement date of April 2024. 2024 reinsurancepremiums for the total program are estimated to be $188.9 million pre-tax, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $207.2 million pre-tax for 2023, reflecting impactsfrom changing the timing of program placement in this initial year of transition to a single placement date, as well as favorable underlying rates from improvedreinsurance market conditions. The U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage included a main reinsurance program providing $1.48 billion of coverage in excess of a$150.0 million retention for a first event. Layers 1 through 7 of the program allow for one automatic reinstatement. When combined with the Florida HurricaneCatastrophe Fund, the U.S. program protects against gross Florida losses of up to approximately $1.69 billion, in excess of retention.\nWe are also subject to non-catastrophe risk from isolated fire, water and wind damage, theft and vandalism, as well as general liability in renters andhomeowners policies.

This includes ongoing investments in competitivetotal rewards and wellbeing offerings, and providing programs for learning, development and engagement, while continuously enhancing the experience of ouremployees who are critical to our long-term success.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Assurant had approximately 14,200 employees representing, more than 80 nationalities, with a presence in 21 markets globally. Ourglobal workforce spans a wide range of roles and skills. While 75% of our employee base was located in North America, we continued to expand our presence in keyinternational markets across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific to support our increasingly global client portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, approximately63% of our employees were frontline workers, predominantly in hourly roles such as customer care, claims administration, mobile repair and logistics. Theremaining 37% were in managerial roles, predominantly salaried employees engaged in an array of business and support functions. As of December 31, 2024, 60%of our global workforce were women. In the U.S., our largest market, women accounted for 63% of employees while other underrepresented minority groupsaccounted for 56% of our domestic workforce. We continue to promote and welcome an inclusive workforce across all levels of the Company in support of ourbusiness strategy.\nFor full-year 2024, our global turnover rate was 13%, reflecting our blended workforce of frontline and managerial roles; turnover for managerial and salariedroles was 5%, and turnover for frontline employees was 17%, which is typically higher given the nature of the roles. The turnover rate for both frontline andmanagerial employees improved by 2 and 1 percentage points, respectively, year-over-year . Overall, this is attributed to ongoing actions to identify and remediatetalent risks and enhance the employee experience as well as stabilization in key labor markets.\nThe Board, through the Compensation and Talent Committee, oversees the significant human capital management programs of Assurant, which are led byAssurant\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), its Chief Operating Officer and its Chief People Officer.

We periodically evaluate our compensation practices and for the last several years have engaged in a multi-step payequity assessment process to ensure that we are compensating fairly for employees performing substantially similar job responsibilities. Results from our last reviewcompleted in 2024, which examined base pay and target total cash compensation for U.S.- based employees, and base pay for the U.K.-, Argentina- and Canada-based employees, or roughly 87% of our workforce, confirmed that there is no evidence of systemic disparities for comparable job groupings with similar skill,scope and effort. We expect to continue to assess compensation practices annually and remain committed to remediate any significant pay disparities we maydiscover. We also continue to monitor and adjust market wages as necessary to ensure we provide competitive wages, consistent with our ongoing compensationpractices.\nWe remain committed to investing in our people through competitive rewards and development opportunities. We continued to reward high performers andinvest in merit increases, allocating more funding to front-line employees in recognition of the disproportionate impact of the current challenging economicenvironment. We have advanced our commitment to pay transparency, particularly in North America, by providing applicants and employees with base salary rangesfor their role and grade.\nTotal Rewards and Wellbeing\nWe are committed to the health and safety of our employees as we believe the success of our business is directly connected to their wellbeing.

We will continue to assessadditional opportunities across Total Rewards and Wellbeing to help attract and retain top talent.\nRecognizing the benefit of flexible work arrangements for our business, customers and employees, we continued to enable a long-term shift to a hybrid workmodel to support our business and talent strategy. A majority of our employees work virtually on a full-time or part-time basis. While we will continue to encouragepurposeful in-person engagement to support our culture, team development and product innovation, we believe our hybrid work model will remain a key competitiveadvantage to support the evolving needs of our customers and employees. Within this hybrid environment, we introduced a new framework to support enterpriseengagement. We continued our ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given our increasingly hybrid workforce, while makingnecessary investments in key facilities (such as our Nashville Innovation and Device Care Center) and markets to support the long-term strategy of the Company.\nLearning and Development\nLearning and development are essential to Assurant\u2019s success. We continually invest in our employees\u2019 career growth and provide employees with a wide rangeof training and development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual and self-directed learning, mentoring and external development opportunities through aportfolio of initiatives called Leading the Way, which is designed to unlock the potential of our talent to achieve our vision and purpose. Leading the Way is intendedto further grow skills, capabilities and careers to impact engagement, performance and drive results. Strengthening employees\u2019 leadership, technical and professionalskills to broaden career opportunities, while also reinforcing a culture of strong ethics and compliance, are primary focus areas. We continue to implement keyinitiatives to support upskilling and reskilling and increase adoption of new technology and processes by providing both learning and change support, furthering ourfocus on a digital-first mindset. In 2024, this included the ongoing integration of AI tools to enhance and improve the employee and customer experience with theappropriate training and reporting to ensure we effectively govern deployed solutions and continuously learn. We also continued to provide all employees withaccess to industry leading content and a virtual mentor to further develop professional, technical, and managerial skills. This also included specific access fortechnology employees to immerse in technology labs and assessments as we look to expand critical skills in this area. Additionally, Assurant assists employees in thepursuit of undergraduate and graduate degrees, certifications and continuing education required by certain professional organizations.\nWe have adapted our learning and development programs and delivery modes to meet the varying needs of our business and our predominantly virtualworkforce. We provide a broad array of training on topics such as managing virtual and hybrid teams, mental health awareness and building resilience, managerialskills and inclusion. In 2024, we continued to enhance our manager and senior leader programming to strengthen our bench of future ready leaders. In addition, weimplemented an enterprise-wide mentorship program to help support emerging talent.\nSuccession Planning\nAn important element of our talent strategy is succession planning and building leadership pipelines for our most critical roles across the organization.\nWe assess the performance and potential of current incumbents, identify and assess potential successors, and create targeted development plans to strengthenthe preparedness of our talent pipeline. Annually, we conduct a comprehensive talent review to discuss potential successors of our Management Committee and otherkey leadership roles, as well as a broader group of top talent as we look to ensure better visibility into our strengths and opportunities for prioritized roles. TheCompensation & Talent Committee annually reviews the CEO succession plan and succession plans for senior executives, which includes emergency successors foreach role, and conducts a broader talent review with the goal to ensure we have the right leadership in place to execute the Company\u2019s long-term strategic plans.\nFor more information on our human capital resources, please refer to our most recent Sustainability Report available at https://www.assurant.com/our-story/sustainability and our most recent Proxy Statement available at ir.assurant.com.

To that end, the laws of the various jurisdictionsestablish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as:\n\u2022 licensing;\n\u2022 capital, surplus and dividends;\n\u2022 underwriting requirements and limitations (including, in some cases, minimum or target loss ratios);\n\u2022 entrance into and exit from markets;\n\u2022 introduction, cancellation and termination of certain coverages;\n\u2022 statutory accounting and annual statement disclosure requirements;\n\u2022 product types, policy forms and mandated insurance benefits;\n\u2022 premium rates;\n\u2022 fines, penalties and assessments;\n\u2022 claims practices, including occasional regulatory requirements to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts;\n\u2022 transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022 the form and content of disclosures to consumers;\n\u2022 the type, amounts and valuation of investments;\n\u2022 annual tests of solvency and reserve adequacy;\n\u2022 assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the recovery of assessments through premium increases; and  \n\u2022 market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents.\n14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4007, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c97ed393-29d6-4654-872c-8c5487f44b83": {"__data__": {"id_": "c97ed393-29d6-4654-872c-8c5487f44b83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3b6b35f-31e9-46d4-92ba-21513117ef6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "52edae095d0826c6518abf312eb38719ef90c60e64f6a2fa66b4a9ed13ab0fc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c34f54bd-7cc4-4b67-8edd-a9dd5cad2ddc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9779d8379fbda1b15ea60d73bb9be730aa39f340f593d711b567259e0c9d4d56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Risk-Based Capital Requirements. In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d)has established certain risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) standards applicable to life, health and property and casualty insurers. RBC, which regulators use to assess thesufficiency of an insurer\u2019s statutory capital, is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, expense, liability and reserve items. Factors are higher foritems that the NAIC views as having greater underlying risk. The NAIC periodically reviews the RBC formula and changes to the formula could occur in the future.\nInvestment Regulation. Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the kind, quality and concentration ofinvestments made by insurance companies. These regulations require diversification of insurance company investment portfolios and limit the amount ofinvestments in certain asset categories.\nProducts and Coverage. Insurance regulators have broad authority to regulate many aspects of our products and services. Additionally, certain non-insuranceproducts and services we offer, such as service contracts, may be regulated by regulatory bodies other than departments of insurance and may be subject to consumerprotection laws.\nPricing and Premium Rates. Nearly all states and territories have insurance laws requiring insurers to file price schedules and policy forms with the state\u2019s orterritory\u2019s regulatory authority. In many cases, these price schedules and/or policy forms must be approved prior to use, and state and territory insurance departmentshave the power to disapprove increases or require decreases in the premium rates we charge.\nMarket Conduct Regulation. Activities of insurers are highly regulated by state and territory insurance laws and regulations, that govern the form and contentof disclosure to consumers, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State and territory regulatory authorities enforce compliance through periodic marketconduct examinations.\nGuaranty Associations and Indemnity Funds. Most states and territories require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds,which are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. These associations may levy assessments on member insurers. In some states andterritories, member insurers can recover a portion of these assessments through premium tax offsets and/or policyholder surcharges.\nInsurance Regulatory Initiatives. The NAIC, state and territory regulators and professional organizations have considered and are considering variousproposals that may alter or increase state and territory authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. For example, in 2021, the NAICadopted the NAIC Real Property Lender-Placed Insurance Model Act (the \u201cLPI Model Act\u201d). The LPI Model Act governs the insurance that a mortgage servicerobtains when a borrower fails to obtain or maintain required insurance. Several states have enacted legislation that mirrors the LPI Model Act. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013 RiskFactors \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Risks \u2013 Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth\u201d for a discussion of the risks related tosuch initiatives.\nFederal Regulation\nAlthough our business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways.Impacted areas include financial services regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulationof insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013Risk Factors \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Risks \u2013 Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\u201d\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act. We are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d).ERISA places certain requirements on how we may administer employee benefit plans covered by ERISA. Among other things, regulations under ERISA setstandards for certain notice and disclosure requirements and for claim processing and appeals.\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Certain of our activities are subject to the privacy requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, along with regulationsadopted thereunder, generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal financial information is used and theopportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of certain disclosures, if applicable.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) address mortgage servicers\u2019 obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; provide certain information requested by suchborrowers; and provide protections to such borrowers in connection with lender-placed insurance.

The Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, enacted as partof the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, creates a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) on certain large \u201capplicable corporations\u201d and an excise tax of1% on stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations, both effective after December 31, 2022. The excise tax on common stock repurchases is classified asan additional cost of the stock acquired included in treasury stock in shareholders' equity. The Company has determined that it is not considered an \u201capplicablecorporation\u201d under the rules of CAMT.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released Pillar Two Model Rules, a 15% minimum effective tax rate designed to ensure thatlarge multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate and mandates sharing of certain companyinformation with taxing authorities on a local and global basis. Certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others have proposed, legislation to implement certainprovisions of Pillar Two. We are continuing to monitor the implications resulting from the potential enactment of Pillar Two rules in the jurisdictions where weoperate, and do not currently anticipate a material impact.

These regulations, which vary depending on thejurisdiction, include, among others, anti-corruption laws; solvency and market conduct regulations; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws andregulations; and corporate, employment, intellectual property and investment laws and regulations. We operate in various jurisdictions, including Canada, the U.K.,France, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Japan, South Korea,Hong Kong and Singapore, and, in several of these jurisdictions, our businesses are supervised by local regulatory authorities. In fourth quarter 2023, we made thedecision to fully exit our operations in mainland China (other than Hong Kong), which were subsequently sold in 2024. See Note 5 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.\nIn the past few years, the IAIS developed a model common framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (\u201cIAIGs\u201d), whichincludes group-wide supervisory oversight across national boundaries and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges (\u201cComFrame\u201d). ComFrame applies toentities that meet the IAIS\u2019s criteria for IAIGs and that are so designated by their group-wide supervisor. The NAIC previously adopted changes to the ModelInsurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to allow state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs.While we do not currently meet the criteria for IAIG designation, we are monitoring developments of reforms adopted by the IAIS as they influence NAIC activities,including those related to risk and group capital oversight.\nSecurities and Corporate Governance Regulation  \nAs a company with publicly-traded securities, we are subject to certain legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, includingthe rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) relating to public reportingand disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance and other matters.

Additionally, we and our subsidiaries aresubject to the corporate governance laws of our respective jurisdictions of incorporation or formation.\nConsumer Protection Laws\nNumerous federal, state and international consumer protection laws affect the Company. For example, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established theCFPB to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers.

These laws and regulations arecontinuously evolving and developing. Since the enactment of EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), multiple countries where we conduct businesshave or are in the process of enacting comprehensive data protection laws that largely model GDPR. In the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal andstate privacy and data security laws and regulations. At the state level, the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law has been enacted in multiple states, imposingan array of detailed security measures, reporting and attestation requirements on insurance companies. The accelerated rate of adoption poses challenges forbusinesses as implementation and compliance may necessitate modifications to businesses processes, technological infrastructure, security measures and customer-facing websites.\nCybersecurity risks and incidents remain a focus for regulators. For example, in July 2023, the SEC adopted new rules for public companies requiringdisclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and periodic disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Furthermore, inNovember 2023, the New York Department of Financial Services (the \u201cNYDFS\u201d) finalized amendments to its cybersecurity rule applicable to financial institutionslicensed by the NYDFS.\nIn addition, we are monitoring increased regulatory activity related to artificial intelligence, including machine learning tools. For example, the NAIC hasadopted a model bulletin, The Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers, to inform and articulate general expectations on how insurers will govern thedevelopment, acquisition and use of certain artificial intelligence technologies. Approximately 20 states have adopted the bulletin with additional adoption expectedin 2025, and several other states, such as Colorado, New York and California have adopted their own AI regulations or guidance specific for the insurance industry.Internationally, on August 1, 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, the first comprehensive legal framework for the regulation of artificial intelligencesystems across the EU, went into force, with enforcement beginning in 2026.\nClimate-Related Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and international regulations regarding climate risk disclosure. In March 2024, the SEC adopted new rules fordisclosing climate-related risks, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, and climate-related financial metrics.

Many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships.

Examples of important business arrangements include, in Global Lifestyle, exclusive and non-exclusive relationships withmobile service providers (including carriers, retailers, OEMs and cable operators), dealerships and agents, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers(including e-commerce retailers), and financial, insurance and other institutions through which we distribute our products and services.

See \u201c \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Our actual claims losses may exceed ourreserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital.\u201d\nBecause Global Housing\u2019s lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provideproperty coverage for client portfolios, our exposure to certain catastrophe-prone locations, such as Florida, California and Texas, may increase. The withdrawal ofother insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas, and it may negatively affect our lossexperience and increase our costs.\nNegative publicity relating to our business, industry or clients may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual customers. From time to time, regulators, consumer advocacy groups,the media and individual customers may focus their attention on our products and services, or on the broader industries in which we operate, which may subject us tonegative publicity. We may be negatively affected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry, or if one of our clients, engages in practicesthat subject our industry or businesses to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, social media,regulatory or governmental actions with respect to our products or services and industry commercial practices. For example, regulators may submit queries to assesspractices in the insurance sector that potentially disadvantage people of color or historically underrepresented groups in certain insurance lines of business, orwhether customers have received fair value from our products and services. In addition, there is increased stakeholder and regulatory focus on sustainability matters,including workforce inclusion and efforts related to climate. A failure or perceived failure in our achievement of various sustainability initiatives and goals weannounce from time to time, or an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry\u2019s business activities, may subject us to negativepublicity. As stakeholder perceptions of sustainability continue to evolve, we may also face negative publicity based on certain \u201canti-ESG\u201d sentiment.\nNegative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civiland criminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability tomarket our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products andservices we offer or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\nMacroeconomic, Political and Global Market Risks\nGeneral economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.\nLimited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, includingin Europe, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment or labor shortages, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates,disruptive geopolitical events, including the Israel-Hamas war, China-Taiwan relations and supply chain disruptions, and other events outside of our control, such asa major epidemic or a pandemic, political or civil unrest, or the possibility of a U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5368, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5009004-214e-4a2e-92c0-22031bf51dfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5009004-214e-4a2e-92c0-22031bf51dfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4163836c-ee2a-408c-adc3-5f437417e365", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "f5c54e27ded8c0c506424c91c08b2d21ade118f8b656e556461347b717567db1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "878a05b8-c9bb-4499-a5b0-7e6028d99035", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "6cc30ac1a752ce74414885196e08bb269910ff15b71aedaa2cf1b0c1c6bd2204", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "government shutdown or default on its debt obligations, could contribute, and insome cases have contributed, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock.

Whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Statutory Accounting Principles or accounting principles applicable in foreign jurisdictions, reserves are estimates. Reserving is inherently amatter of judgment and our ultimate liabilities could exceed reserves for a variety of reasons, including changes in macroeconomic factors (such as inflation,unemployment and interest rates), case development and other factors. From time to time, we adjust our reserves, and may adjust our reserving methodology, asthese factors, our claims experience and estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity change. Reserve adjustments have caused volatility in ourreported results. Reserve development, changes in our reserving methodology and paid losses exceeding corresponding reserves could have a material adverse effecton our results of operations, profitability and capital.

A.M. Best rates most of our domestic and certaininternational operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody\u2019s and S&P rate three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are subject to periodicreview by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Rating agencies may change their methodology or requirementsfor determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Rating agencies could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries or theenterprise, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary or at the holding company. Any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect ourstanding in the insurance industry and the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers, which could materially adversely affect our results ofoperations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintainminimum financial strength ratings, typically from A.M. Best, ranging from \u201cA\u201d or better to \u201cB+\u201d or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminatethese contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries\u2019 ratings fall below these minimums.

A downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity and ability toaccess liquidity quickly or at all, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities, and increase the expense and difficulty of financing ouroperations, including temporary financing for subsidiaries necessary to address any immediate liquidity concerns, or refinancing our existing indebtedness on similaror more favorable terms. For example, the interest rate payable on certain series of our senior notes is subject to increase if either S&P or Moody\u2019s downgrades thecredit rating assigned to such series of senior notes to BB+ or below or to Ba1 or below, respectively. Additionally, we could be subject to more restrictive financialand operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that our credit ratingswill not be downgraded. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on our senior notes andthe impact of rating changes.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile most of our costs and revenues are in U.S. Dollars, some are in other currencies, including labor costs in our international locations and GlobalCapability Centers. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation, our results ofoperations, including period-over-period comparisons, have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. Dollar weakensagainst a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and netincome. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against a local currency. In 2024, wereported a $0.8 million unfavorable impact to net income due to foreign exchange-related losses. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in lossesthat materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may incur foreign exchange losses in connection with the designation of the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency of our internationalsubsidiaries.

While management has certified that our internal controlover financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, because internal control over financial reporting is complex, there can be no assurance that ourinternal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. We rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error andinternal control failure compared to automated processes. Although we have implemented an integrated global financial system in North America and are in theprocess of implementing it globally to, among other things, minimize our reliance on and use of manual processes, there can be no assurance that the implementationwill achieve all of its intended goals. Any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties or errors encountered in their operation, including as a result ofremote work arrangements, could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are not able to maintain ordocument effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to certify the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting or opine that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations andcash flows in conformity with GAAP. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting may prevent us from reporting ourfinancial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatoryconsequences, including fines and other sanctions, and would require us to claw back certain executive compensation, which would be costly and time-consuming. Ifany of the foregoing were to occur, investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements could erode, resulting in a decline in our stock price,impairing our ability to raise capital, negatively affecting our reputation and subjecting us to legal and regulatory risk.\nUnfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to pay our debts or expenses.\nThe global capital and credit markets have experienced periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including the possibility of a U.S. governmentshutdown or default on its debt obligations, changes to U.S. and foreign tax and trade policies, imposition of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions, othergovernment actions, foreign currency fluctuations and other factors. Our ability to raise money during such periods could be severely or entirely restricted. Ourability to borrow or raise money is important if our operating cash flow is insufficient to pay our expenses, meet capital requirements, repay debt, pay dividends onour common stock or make investments.

Changes in interest rates have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect the performanceof some of our investments, including by materially reducing the fair value of and investment income from fixed maturity securities and increasing unrealized lossesin our investment portfolio, which can adversely impact our capital. As of December 31, 2024, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% of our totalinvestments and full year 2024 gross investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $385.9 million. The fair market value of fixed maturity securitiesgenerally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments infixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases directly with fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, actual investment income and cash flows frominvestments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as aresult of interest rate fluctuations.\nRecent periods have been characterized by substantial volatility in interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at high levels may resultin greater unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Conversely, a prolonged period during which interest rates are at lower levels may result in lower-than-expected investment income. We attempt to mitigate certain interest rate risk with hedging activities but such activities may not be effective. Though we employasset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate changes, significant fluctuations may require us to liquidate investments prior tomaturity at a significant loss to pay claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \u2013Interest Rate Risk\u201d in this Report.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bondsand commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and result in realizedinvestment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, increases intreasury rates or credit spreads and by other factors that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments. Thedetermination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary impairment requires the judgment of management and there are inherent risks and uncertaintiesinvolved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments haveoccurred, which could lead to additional losses on investments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. Forfurther details on net investment losses, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nThe value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of its issuer. As of December 31, 2024, fixed maturitysecurities represented approximately 84% and below investment grade securities (rated \u201cBB\u201d or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations)represented approximately 6% of our total investments. Below investment grade securities generally are expected to provide higher returns but present greater riskand can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materiallyadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \u2013 Credit Risk\u201d in thisReport for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity securities portfolio.\nEquity securities represented approximately 2% of our total investments as of December 31, 2024. However, we have had higher percentages of equitysecurities in the past and may make more equity investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally are expected to provide higher total returns butpresent greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity securities.

Under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuationallowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realizationof deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carry-forward periods.\nIn determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss andtax credit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income of the appropriate character and available tax planning strategies. The assumptions in makingthese judgments are updated periodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting us and overall economic conditions. These management judgments aretherefore subject to change due to factors that include changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or inour ability to execute other tax planning strategies. Furthermore, any future changes in tax laws could impact the value of our deferred tax assets. Management willcontinue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods. Any change in the valuation allowance could have amaterial adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.\nAs part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. Wealso access the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (\u201cFHCF\u201d) to reinsure eligible Florida risks. Although reinsurers are liable to us for claims properly ceded underour reinsurance arrangements, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminateour obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit and other risks with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers and the FHCF. The inabilityto collect amounts due from reinsurers and any changes in the FHCF could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions, which have been, and in the future may continue to be,adversely impacted by: the occurrence of significant reinsured events, including catastrophes; expectations regarding increased occurrences of such events due toclimate change; and other impacts on reinsurers\u2019 capital, such as increased demand for coverage driven by inflation, a volatile investment market or litigation costs.In the future, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage for some of our businesses at commercially reasonable rates or at all. In such a situation, we mightbe adversely affected by state and other regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophe exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in\ncatastrophe-prone areas where we are required to provide property coverage for client portfolios. In addition, we may not be able to renew our current reinsurance\nfacilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts, at favorable rates and with favorable terms. The inability to obtain reinsurance at favorable ratesor at all could cause us to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, take more risk, hold more capital or incur higher costs. Any of these developmentscould materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThrough reinsurance, we have sold or exited businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers becomeinsolvent.\nIn the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties.

If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and stockholders will have no rightto proceed against our subsidiary\u2019s assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of our subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy orwinding-up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating tothat subsidiary and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary.\nThe payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) mustbe approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, arelimited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out ofearned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as paymentsunder a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that wouldotherwise be permitted without prior approval. Future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends. For moreinformation on the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us in 2024 under applicable laws and regulations,without prior regulatory approval, see \u201cItem 5 \u2013 Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \u2013 Dividend Policy.\u201d\nAny additional material restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on ourcommon stock, service our debt and pay other expenses.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by the Board in its sole discretion and will depend on variousfactors, including: our subsidiaries\u2019 payment of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financialcondition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment ofdividends; and any other factor the Board deems relevant. The payment of dividends on our common stock may be subject to the preferential rights of any preferredstock that the Board may create from time to time.

Some of the Company\u2019s technology systems and software are legacy-typesystems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards, including business continuityprocedures. We continue to upgrade and implement new information technology systems and infrastructure involving several enterprise-wide technology initiativesto support our strategy and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. Thisincludes implementing an integrated global financial system; enhancing existing systems, procedures and controls; developing new systems and products; andretiring certain legacy systems. We have also migrated many of our systems and applications to the cloud, which is key to our technology strategy. We currently relyon significant manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. We mustintegrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performancecapabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations.\nOur ability to modernize our technology systems and infrastructure requires us to execute large-scale, complex programs and projects, which rely on thecommitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes.

We are at risk of attack, and from time to time have been the subject of an attack, by a growing list of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations,organized crime, hackers and \u201chacktivists\u201d (activist hackers), through the use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including long-term, persistent attacksreferred to as advanced persistent threats, attacks via yet unknown vulnerabilities referred to as zero-day threats and credential harvesting attacks against ouremployees. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launchedagainst a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in potential data loss or other damage totechnology systems.

The Board reviews management\u2019s assessment of our key enterprise risks and its strategy with respect toeach risk, including cybersecurity risks, and receives a corresponding risk management update annually. The Information Technology Committee of the Boardreviews the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and procedures, including procedures to identify and assess internal and external risks from cybersecuritythreats; controls to prevent and protect from cyberattacks, unauthorized access or other malicious acts and risks; procedures to detect, respond to, mitigate negativeeffects from and remediate cybersecurity attacks; and controls and procedures for fulfilling applicable regulatory reporting and disclosure obligations of the risks andcosts of cybersecurity incidents. Our Chief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d) briefs or provides a report to the Information Technology Committee on ourcybersecurity and information security posture and program at least quarterly, including penetration test results and related remediation and significant cybersecurityincidents. The CISO also provides an annual cybersecurity update to the full Board.\nRole of Management\nCybersecurity risk is integrated into our Global Risk Management process. Cybersecurity risk continues to be identified as one of our key enterprise risks. Riskowners from the Management Committee, senior leadership and the Global Risk Management function have been assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, whichare tracked and reported at least quarterly to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board and annually to the full Board. See \u201cItem 1 \u2013 Business \u2013 Global RiskManagement\u201d for more information on the Global Risk Management function.\nOur CISO, who reports to our Global Technology Officer on the Management Committee, has over 20 years of information technology and security programmanagement experience, holds a Certified Information Security Manager certification and has led our information security team, including information technologycompliance and risk management, since 2009. Our Global Technology Officer joined the Company in 2016 and has over 30 years of information technologyexperience, including leading global digital, security, infrastructure, cloud services and application teams. Prior to joining the Company in 2016, our GlobalTechnology Officer was chief information officer at a large, publicly-traded energy company.\nOur CISO has implemented a management-level governance structure and process to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks, and to manage ouroverall information security program. The Information Security Board, led by our CISO and comprised of leaders from all of our lines of business and key functionalareas such as Global Risk Management, Privacy and Compliance, as well as members of our information security team, meets quarterly, and is responsible foroverseeing our information security program, including our information security strategy and related policies and standards.

This decrease was partially offset by a modest increase in Connected Living primarily due to increased contributions inGlobal Financial Services, higher investment income and improved results within extended service contracts.\nGlobal Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $405.9 million, or 5%, to $8.97 billion for the Twelve Months 2024 from $8.56 billionfor Twelve Months 2023, primarily due to contributions from newly launched trade-in programs and device protection programs.\nGlobal Housing Adjusted EBITDA increased $97.0 million, or 17%, to $671.2 million for Twelve Months 2024 from $574.2 million for Twelve Months 2023,primarily driven by growth in Homeowners, partially offset by $134.2 million of higher pre-tax reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable catastrophes, AdjustedEBITDA increased 34% due to top-line growth and expense leverage within Homeowners, more favorable prior year reserve development, lower reinsurance costs,and growth in Renters from the property management channel.\nGlobal Housing net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $314.1 million, or 15%, to $2.46 billion for Twelve Months 2024 from $2.14 billion forTwelve Months 2023, primarily due to Homeowners top-line growth, including growth in policies in-force and higher average premiums within lender-placed, aswell as growth across various specialty Homeowners products.\nCorporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was $(122.2) million for Twelve Months 2024 compared to $(109.0) million for Twelve Months 2023, primarily drivenby higher third-party and employee-related expenses.\nIn addition, the California Wildfires began in January 2025, causing significant damage throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area and surrounding regions.At the time of this filing, the claims process continues and our current view is that reportable catastrophes from the California Wildfires are expected to approach or\nslightly exceed our catastrophe reinsurance program per event retention of $150 million. There is inherent variability in our estimates of early loss projections andclaims severity, and therefore the estimate may change as additional information emerges.\nCritical Factors Affecting Results \nOur results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for futurepolicyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investmentincome, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. Our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow our businesses,including our Connected Living, Global Automotive and Renters businesses, and the performance of our Homeowners business. Factors affecting these items,including conditions in the financial markets, the global economy, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interestrates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures which have impacted claims costs including in the Global Automotive business, and tariffsand global supply chain disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information on these and otherfactors that could affect our results, see \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors.\u201d \nOur results may also be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, which will be impacted by our ability to provide asuperior customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, capitalize on the connected home opportunity and investments toonboard and ramp-up new business.

We had $1.81 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024. Please see \u201c \u2013 Liquidity and CapitalResources\u201d below for further details.\nRevenues \nWe generate revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies, service contracts and related products and services, and from income earned on ourinvestments. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. \nOur premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends,change in market value of equity securities and sales of investments. Currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Bothinvestment income and changes in market value on these investments can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. \nInterest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or losses in our investment portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors,including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, inflation and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuationsin interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term investments. \nThe fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending ongeneral economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, whilenet investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases with fluctuations in interest rates. We alsohave investments that are subject to pre-payment risk, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Interest rate fluctuations may cause actual netinvestment income and/or timing of cash flows from such investments to differ from estimates made at the time of investment. In periods of declining interest rates,mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed asborrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. Therefore, in these circumstances we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-earning investments.\nPlease see \u201cItem 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d below for further details.\nExpenses \nOur expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. \nPolicyholder benefits are affected by our claims management programs, reinsurance coverage, contractual terms and conditions, regulatory requirements,economic conditions including inflation, and numerous other factors. Benefits paid or reserves required for future benefits could substantially exceed ourexpectations, causing a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred costs,general operating expenses and income taxes. In addition to the restructuring plan announced in December 2022 and amended in 2023, we continue to undertakevarious expense savings initiatives while also making investments in talent, capabilities and technology, among other things, which will impact our expenses.\nWe also incur interest expense related to our debt. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain items in our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on estimates and judgment. Differences between actual results and these estimates andjudgments could in some cases have material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Calculations incorporate assumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reportinglags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. While the methods of making such estimatesand establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated, the estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management isusing historical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes. \nThe recorded reserves represent our best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, basedupon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves may be impacted by futuretrends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, including:changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handlingprocedures.\nMany of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. Reserve estimates are refined asexperience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which suchestimates are updated. \nBecause establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that futuresettlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves. Future loss development could requirereserves to be increased or decreased, which could have a material effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases or decreases are made. However,based on information currently available, we believe our reserve estimates are adequate. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Our actual claims lossesmay exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital\u201d and \u201c \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Actual results may differ materially from the analyticalmodels we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management\u201d for more detail on this risk.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nWe utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and client risk and profit sharing. Reinsurance premiums paid areamortized as reductions to premium over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistentwith claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. Reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers for claimspaid as well as those included in reserve estimates that are subject to the reinsurance.\nWe use a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating an expected credit loss allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers areused in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims andbenefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld,assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral.Our methodology incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratingsservice. The allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevantfactors.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies.

Periodically, we reviewemerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptions where necessary.\nUltimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. Both paid claims development as wellas case incurred development are typically analyzed at the product or product grouping level, considering product size and data credibility. The reserving methodswidely employed by us include the Chain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. For Global Housing, reportable catastrophes areanalyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach.\nThe methods all involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. As thedata ages, development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting loss development factorsindicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The underlying premise of the Chain Laddermethod is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method employs a combination of pastclaims development and estimates of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. The Munich Chain Ladder method incorporates the correlations between paidand incurred development in projecting future development factors, and is typically more applicable to products experiencing variability in incurred to paid ratios.\nEach of these methods applied to the data groupings produces an estimate of the loss reserves for the product grouping. The best estimate is generally selectedfrom a blend of the different methods. The determination of the best estimate is based on many factors, including:  \n\u2022 the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions;\n\u2022 the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data;\n\u2022 current and expected future economic and market conditions;\n\u2022 regulatory, legislative, and judicial considerations;\n\u2022 the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply;\n\u2022 trends in loss frequency and severity for various causes of loss;\n\u2022 consideration of the distribution of loss reserves, management\u2019s selection of the best estimate that may exceed an estimate based on median values,suggesting that favorable development may be more likely than unfavorable development; and\n\u2022 hindsight testing of prior loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others.\nWhen employing the reserving methods, consideration is given to contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, coveragechanges, seasonality, product mix, the legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors, natural catastrophes and other relevant factors. We consistentlyapply reserving principles and methodologies from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.\nWhile management has used judgment in establishing its best estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantlydifferent reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and lossseverity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls, changes in economic activityand weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. \nIf the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management\u2019s estimate.The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2024 would be as follows:\n49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4266, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f03052ee-516b-41a2-a27f-bb771c5b8d90": {"__data__": {"id_": "f03052ee-516b-41a2-a27f-bb771c5b8d90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "438c0c1f-b8b7-46f2-aad1-583d9034f7e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "08601f7e6ab5c98e2f5bfaa7f3e6331128662d7909d711160e71038ccecc988b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Change in both loss frequency and severity for all Global Lifestyle and Global Housing\nUltimate cost of claims occurring in2024 Change in cost of claims occurringin 2024\n3% higher $ 2,765.8 $ 158.8 \n2% higher $ 2,712.3 $ 105.3 \n1% higher $ 2,659.4 $ 52.4 \nBase scenario (1) $ 2,607.0 $ \u2014 \n1% lower $ 2,555.1 $ (51.9)\n2% lower $ 2,503.8 $ (103.2)\n3% lower $ 2,452.9 $ (154.1)\n(1) Represents the sum of the case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves as of December 31, 2024 for Global Lifestyle and Global Housing.\nNon-Core Operations\nShort duration contracts in non-core operations primarily consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within GlobalHousing. While the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tailcompared to property coverages which make up most of our core operations.\nThe reserving methodology described for other short duration contacts is applicable for non-core operations. Given the nature of commercial liability coveragesand its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on elevated loss activity from increasing attorney involvement and analysis of individualcase reserve adequacy on known claims. This is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include an allowance for future inflation impacts, detailedopen claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement our own historical claims experience.\nLong Duration Contracts, including Disposed and Runoff Long Duration Lines\nReserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future netpremiums. Reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. Theseassumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions forpossible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in ourconsolidated statements of operations.\nRisks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity and long-term care insurance policies have been fully ceded viareinsurance. While we have not been released from our contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity,and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assumingreinsurer.\nValuation of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in activemarkets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices for identicalor similar investments in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs. If these observable inputs are not available, or observable inputs are notdeterminable, unobservable inputs or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value ofinvestments. The methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability tosell investments and the price ultimately realized for investments depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market.\nSee also Notes 2, 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Ourinvestment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\u201d and \u201c \u2013 Investments\u201dcontained in this Item 7. \nValuation and Recoverability of Goodwill\nOur goodwill related to acquisitions of businesses was $2.62 billion and $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. Any adversechange in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our Consolidated FinancialStatements. \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business forwhich discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can beaggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value,including goodwill, of the reporting unit over its fair value. An impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nOur Global Lifestyle operating segment is disaggregated into two reporting units: Connected Living and Global Automotive.

Based on thisassessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units\u2019 fair values were more than their respective book values and thereforequantitative impairment testing was not necessary for Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing as of October 1, 2024.\nShould the operating results of these reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, or changes to macroeconomic conditions having apotential impact of substantially reducing future profitability of the reporting units, we could determine that we need to perform an updated impairment test due tothe potential impairment indicators, which may require the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in any of the reporting units.\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for further detail.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\n51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3142, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c224223-927c-49ae-9bba-56985e497fd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c224223-927c-49ae-9bba-56985e497fd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0fa0311b-5bc3-4bce-90e2-84993cfdf024", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "23b7b6c10b0009262cfa30ff1c1ca039af4bedd43564ae82705af2ed6c9fed57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Results of Operations\nAssurant Consolidated\nThe table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations:\n For the Years Ended December 31,\n 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nNet earned premiums $ 9,795.8 $ 9,388.0 \nFees and other income 1,638.6 1,323.2 \nNet investment income 518.9 489.1 \nNet realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities (75.8) (68.7)\nTotal revenues 11,877.5 11,131.6 \nBenefits, losses and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits 2,766.5 2,521.8 \nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 8,076.7 7,695.1 \nInterest expense 107.0 108.0 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt \u2014 (0.1)\nTotal benefits, losses and expenses 10,950.2 10,324.8 \nIncome before provision for income taxes 927.3 806.8 \nProvision for income taxes 167.1 164.3 \nNet income $ 760.2 $ 642.5 \nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nNet Income\nConsolidated net income increased $117.7 million, or 18%, to $760.2 million for Twelve Months 2024 from $642.5 million for Twelve Months 2023, primarilydriven by higher earnings in Global Housing, a $31.0 million favorable change in after-tax foreign exchange related gains (losses), a $32.2 million after-tax declinein losses related to our non-core operations and a $22.9 million reduction in after-tax restructuring costs related to our previously announced restructuring plan.

Management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months, including theability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock.\nOn January 22, 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell our Miami, Florida property for a purchase price of $126.0 million, subject to the buyer receiving therequisite development approvals, which could take 18 to 24 months. If the transaction is consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we expect to record again above the current carrying value of $46.0 million as of December 31, 2024, less estimated costs to sell. We do not anticipate that any such gain will impact ourcapital deployment priorities. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated.\n57", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3595, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10adaece-1101-4e6b-accb-5c5fad1a232f": {"__data__": {"id_": "10adaece-1101-4e6b-accb-5c5fad1a232f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "545ebc7f-97a9-42a1-bd3d-e901c69ac804", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "b0eace50a8c774c736a40002ebe48413d79ccc7d4ecc28ddec0f39a181a7c210", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "098729d5-e63a-40af-9084-87d0725b0940", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "33ad2fdcc6aa30ba2c39d06d16f18029b8d46e098b2ed6bbd91a9c95726abf9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Regulatory Requirements \nAssurant, Inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries.Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as paymentsunder our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay such dividends and make such otherpayments is regulated by the states and territories in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. These dividend regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and bytype of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary, but generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit theamount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. See \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Legal and Regulatory Risks \u2013 Changes in insurance regulation may reduceour profitability and limit our growth.\u201d Along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends from insurancesubsidiaries is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from A.M. Best. For the year ending December 31, 2025, the maximumamount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval, isapproximately $524.2 million. Our international and non-insurance subsidiaries provide additional sources of dividends.\nRegulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiariesor the enterprise.

The target minimum level of holding company liquidity, which can be used for unforeseen capital needs at our subsidiaries or liquidity needs at the holdingcompany, is calibrated based on approximately one year of pre-tax corporate operating losses and interest expenses. We use the term \u201cholding company liquidity\u201d torepresent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at Assurant, Inc. (out of a total of $760.1 million as of December 31, 2024) which we are nototherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. We can use such assets for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions and othercorporate purposes.\nDividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for or as a result of acquisitions orreceived from dispositions, were $804.7 million and $772.6 million for Twelve Months 2024 and Twelve Months 2023, respectively. We use these cash inflowsprimarily to pay holding company operating expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to fundinvestments and acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. From time to time, we may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases orprivately negotiated transactions.\nDividends and Repurchases\nDuring Twelve Months 2024 and Twelve Months 2023, we made common stock repurchases and paid dividends to our common stockholders of $455.8 millionand $352.3 million, respectively.\nOn January 16, 2025, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.80 per common share payable on March 31, 2025 to stockholders of record as ofFebruary 3, 2025.

The total gross reserve for fully reinsured runoff operations that was excluded was $642.1 million which, if the reinsurers defaulted, would be payable over a 30+ year period with themajority of the payments occurring after 5 years. Additional information on the reinsurance arrangements can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisReport. These liabilities also do not include recoverable amounts related to certain high deductible policies in our sharing economy business, included in our non-core operations, for which we areresponsible for paying the entirety of the claim and are subsequently reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. As of December 31, 2024, we had exposure to $168.2 million ofreserves below the deductible that we would be responsible for if the clients were to default on their contractual obligation to pay us the deductible. See Note 4 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Report for more information on our evaluation of the credit risk exposure from these recoverables. As a result, the amounts presented in this table do not agree tothe future policy benefits and expenses and claims and benefits payable in the consolidated balance sheets.(2) Our pension obligations and postretirement benefits include an Assurant Pension Plan, various non-qualified pension plans (including an Executive Pension Plan) and certain life and health carebenefits for retired employees and their dependents (\u201cRetirement Health Benefits\u201d), all of which were frozen in 2016.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and management of such exposures as of December 31, 2024. There were no othersignificant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the yearended December 31, 2023. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in futurereporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from changes in the fair value of our financial instruments, including due to interest rates (including impacts of changes in creditspreads), foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk from counterparties. Market risk is dependent on the volatility and liquidity in the underlying markets inwhich these assets are traded.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities, denominated in both U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changesin interest rates, including impacts of changes in credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk from counterparties. The majority of our fixedincome portfolio is classified as available for sale. The carrying value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $8.54 billion and $8.22billion, respectively, of which 84% was invested in fixed maturity securities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the possibility that the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes ininterest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors.\nOur investment portfolio, including our fixed maturity portfolio, has exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in investment values attributable to interest ratechanges are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our liabilities. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviewsof our asset and liability positions and we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquiditytailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Portfolio duration is primarily managed through cash markettransactions. For additional information, see Notes 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report and \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Investments\u201d.\nThe interest rate sensitivity relating to changes in fair value in our fixed maturity portfolio is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume parallel shifts ofthe yield curves. Our actual experience may differ from the results indicated below, particularly due to the assumptions reflected or if events occur that were notincluded in the methodology. For more information, see \u201cItem 1A \u2013 Risk Factors \u2013 Financial Risks \u2013 Actual results may differ materially from the analytical modelswe use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management.\u201d\nOur sensitivity analysis model produces a loss in fair value in the fixed maturity portfolio of (i) $173.2 million and $170.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and2023, respectively, based on a hypothetical and instantaneous 50 basis point parallel increase in interest rates (including impacts of changes in credit spreads), and(ii) $340.0 million and $333.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on a hypothetical and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase ininterest rates (including impacts of changes in credit spreads).\nOur debt obligations also have exposure to interest rate risk, primarily at the time of refinancing. We monitor market interest rates and evaluate refinancingopportunities for our debt obligations as maturity dates approach. We stagger the maturity dates of our debt to mitigate the interest rate risk in any given year.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes policies andprocedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, andthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) providereasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a materialeffect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nOur management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2024 using criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (COSO). \nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, based on its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, has concluded that our internal control overfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, orare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, basedon criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformitywith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiveinternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by theCOSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, andfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over FinancialReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal controlover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing andevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting andthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nF-1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5502, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d2229ec-9cb8-426c-a93b-ce1298472910": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d2229ec-9cb8-426c-a93b-ce1298472910", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7b74e89-791b-4635-907a-6eb06a226216", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "d118f0f2525a7dd03ec63ab94112c111015d63c67815053c6f80cadb8277e121", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the criticalaudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Claims and Benefits Payable Reserves for Global Lifestyle and Global Housing Short Duration Insurance Contracts\nAs described in Notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains claims and benefits payable reserves for short durationinsurance contracts. Reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future claim payments. The reserveliability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. As of December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s total liability for claims and benefits payable was$2.91 billion, which included $2.61 billion of liabilities for short duration contracts within the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting segments. Claims andbenefits payable reserves include case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; incurred but not reported reserves for claims wherethe insured event has occurred but has not been reported as of the balance sheet date; and loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settlingthe claims. Factors used in the calculation of the reserves include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. As described bymanagement, the best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense is generally selected from a blend of different actuarial methods that are appliedconsistently each period, considering significant assumptions including projected loss development factors and expected loss ratios.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for shortduration insurance contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining their estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditorjudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarial methods and projected loss development factors andexpected loss ratio assumptions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidatedfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for shortduration insurance contracts, including controls over the selection of actuarial methods, completeness and accuracy of claims data and the development of thesignificant assumptions. On a test basis, these procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of historical claims data provided bymanagement and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in either (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining theestimates by evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial methods and the reasonableness of projected loss development factors and expected loss ratioassumptions; or (ii) developing an actuarially determined independent estimate utilizing actual historical data and loss development patterns, as well as industry dataand other benchmarks, and comparing this independent estimate to management\u2019s actuarially determined reserves.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2000.\nF-2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4247, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20658373-9183-4945-9843-a60411f328ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "20658373-9183-4945-9843-a60411f328ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "AIZ 10K -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(\u201cGAAP\u201d). Amounts are presented in United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Dollars and all amounts are in millions, except for number of shares, per share amounts andnumber of securities. Certain prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the realignment of the composition of its reportable segments to correspond withchanges to its operating structure effective January 1, 2023.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries, generally through a greater than 50% ownership ofvoting rights and voting interests. Equity investments in entities that the Company does not consolidate, but where the Company has significant influence or wherethe Company has more than a minor influence over the entity\u2019s operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. All material inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. In order to facilitate the Company\u2019s closing process, financial information from certain foreignsubsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one to three-month lag.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The items affected by the useof estimates include but are not limited to, investments, reinsurance recoverables, premium and accounts receivables, deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d), value ofbusiness acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d), deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances, goodwill, intangible assets, future policy benefits and expenses, unearnedpremiums, claims and benefits payable, deferred gain on disposal of businesses, pension and post-retirement liabilities and commitments and contingencies. Theestimates are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commissions and other acquisition expenses, policyholder behavior and otherfactors. Actual results could differ from the estimates recorded. The Company believes all amounts reported are reasonable and adequate.\nFair Value\nThe Company uses an exit price for its fair value measurements. An exit price is defined as the amount received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability inan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In measuring fair value, the Company gives the highest priority to unadjusted quotedprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. See Note 9 for additional information.\nForeign Currency\nFor foreign affiliates where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses net of deferred income taxeshave been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d). For Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, deferred taxes have not been providedfor unrealized currency translation gains and losses since the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in these other jurisdictions. Transaction gains andlosses on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidatedstatements of operations during the period in which they occur.\nManagement generally identifies highly inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rates over a three-year period exceeds 100%, inaddition to considering other qualitative and quantitative factors. Beginning July 1, 2018, as a result of the classification of Argentina\u2019s economy as highlyinflationary, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to U.S. Dollars. The subsidiaries\u2019 non-U.S. Dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities have been subject to remeasurement since July 1, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, theremeasurement resulted in $3.0 million, $29.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively, of net pre-tax losses which the Company classified within underwriting,selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the relative size of the subsidiaries\u2019 operations and net assetssubject to remeasurement, the Company does not anticipate the ongoing remeasurement to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations orfinancial condition.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company may enter into agreements with other entities that are deemed to be variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Entities that do not have sufficient equityat risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of acontrolling financial interest are referred to as VIEs. A VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest(the \u201cprimary beneficiary\u201d) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and theobligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\nF-9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5400, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21fdce47-85d6-4f8e-a0be-ccea25cdc1fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "21fdce47-85d6-4f8e-a0be-ccea25cdc1fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc633551-2d61-475b-8079-202bdb20e8c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "76ed472611791a85f35824c7ead78e9bb7c8488b6553729c2ac8775cd5aebba9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d07573da-d0a9-48b2-934a-e53dfbbead44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c7ee76c949e404680b2de0762a49186ccb3719713a7ffa5e8598b71c25619d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "significant to the VIE.

The Company only holds non-consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nInvestments\nFixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale as defined in the investments guidance and are reported at fair value. If the fair value is higher thanthe amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain; and, if lower than amortized cost, the difference is an unrealized loss. Net unrealizedgains and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale, less deferred income taxes, are included in AOCI.\nPresentation of credit-related impairments is shown as an allowance, recognizing credit impairments upon purchase of securities as applicable, and requiringreversals of previously recognized credit-related impairments when applicable.\nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for which the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely thannot that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resultedfrom credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes tothe credit rating of the security by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry orgeographic area, among other factors. If this assessment indicates a potential credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected arecompared to the security\u2019s amortized cost basis. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit-relatedimpairment exists, and a charge to income and an associated allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit-related impairment. Any impairment not related tocredit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which fair value is less thanthe amortized cost basis. Upon recognizing a credit-related impairment, the cost basis of the security is not adjusted.\nSubsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. For fixed maturities where the Companyrecords a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value. Write-offs are chargedagainst the allowance when management concludes the financial asset is uncollectible. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, theeffective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par.\nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities that the Company intends to sell, or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sellbefore recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment loss, or difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security, is recognized innet realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities. The new cost basis of the security is the previous amortized cost basis less theimpairment recognized and is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe Company reports receivables for accrued investment income separately from fixed maturities available for sale and elected not to measure allowances forcredit losses for accrued investment income as uncollectible balances are written off in a timely manner.\nEquity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains (losses) oninvestments and fair value changes to equity securities on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The Company has certain equity investments that donot have readily determinable fair values and the Company has elected the measurement alternative to carry such investments at cost, less impairment and to mark tofair value when observable prices in identical or similar investments from the same issuer occur.\nEquity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative are impaired if a qualitative assessment based upon several indicators such as earningsperformance, offers to sell or purchase, ability to continue as a going concern and macroeconomic factors indicates the equity investment is impaired and the fairvalue of the investment is less than its carrying value.

The allowance isestablished for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure tocredit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of thereinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. The methodology used by the Company incorporateshistorical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service.

The Companyaccounts for credit losses using the expected credit loss model for premiums and accounts receivable. For receivables due directly from the insured or consumer, theallowance for credit losses is generally calculated by aging the receivable balances and applying default factors based on the Company\u2019s historical collection data.For receivables due from product sponsors or agents, receivable balances are generally segregated by the sponsor or agent and an appropriate default factor isdetermined based on creditworthiness, billing terms and aging of balances. The financial exposure of a credit loss is determined net of offsets (such as relatedunearned premium reserves for consumer receivables and receivables net of commissions payable, profit share liabilities and captive reinsurance for balances duefrom sponsors/agents) prior to applying a default factor.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nOnly direct and incremental costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts are deferred to the extent that such costs aredeemed recoverable from future premiums. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions and premium taxes. Certain direct response advertising expenses aredeferred when the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who can be shown to have specifically responded to the advertising and the directresponse advertising results in probable future benefits.\nAll other acquisition-related costs, including those related to general advertising and solicitation, market research, agent training, product development,unsuccessful sales and underwriting efforts, as well as all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred.\nPremium deficiency testing is performed annually and generally reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of assumptions including the anticipation ofinvestment income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent apremium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the consolidated statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If thepremium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a loss (and related liability) is recorded for the excess deficiency.\nShort Duration Contracts\nAcquisition costs relating to extended service contracts, vehicle service contracts, mobile device protection, credit insurance, lender-placed homeownersinsurance and flood, multifamily housing and manufactured housing insurance are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Theseacquisition costs consist primarily of advance commissions paid to agents.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Such costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, not to exceed 15 years.Property and equipment are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist.\nGoodwill \nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized, but rather is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company performs the annual goodwillimpairment test as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors,an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flowsdue to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business forwhich discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can beaggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAt the time of the annual goodwill test, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform aquantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company is required to perform an additional quantitative step if it determines qualitatively that it is more likely than not(likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Otherwise, no further testing isrequired. \nIf the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than the carrying value, or otherwise elects to perform thequantitative testing, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its net book value. If the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceedsits net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the reporting unit\u2019s net book value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will berecognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.Refer to Note 14 for further details on goodwill impairment testing for 2024.\nOther Intangible Assets \nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the intangible asset is consumed, which maybe other than straight-line. Estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are required to be reassessed on at least an annual basis. For intangible assets with finitelives, impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the other intangible asset. Generally, other intangible assetswith finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment (\u201ctriggers\u201d) identified. Triggers include a significant adverse change in theextent, manner or length of time in which the intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affectthe value of the other intangible asset.\nVOBA represents the value of expected future profits in unearned premium for insurance contracts acquired in an acquisition. For vehicle service contracts andextended service contracts, such as those purchased in connection with the TWG acquisition, the amount is determined using estimates, for premium earningspatterns, paid loss development patterns, expense loads and discount rates applied to cash flows that include a provision for credit risk. The amount determinedrepresents the purchase price paid to the seller for producing the business. For vehicle service contracts and extended service contracts, VOBA is amortizedconsistent with the premium earning patterns of the underlying in-force contracts. VOBA is tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for recoverability.\nAmortization expense and impairment charges for other intangible assets are included in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in theconsolidated statements of operations. \nOther Assets \nOther assets include prepaid items, income tax receivable, deferred income tax assets, right-of-use assets, dealer loans and inventory associated with theCompany\u2019s mobile protection business.  \nReserves \nReserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future premium and claim payments. Factors used intheir calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments, expected future premiums and actuarial assumptions. Calculations incorporateassumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investmentearnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. The estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is usinghistorical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes.\nF-13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5499, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9946d9ce-90e2-422e-8f3b-4e456aad252b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9946d9ce-90e2-422e-8f3b-4e456aad252b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3fcd6be-5c74-4613-9172-b363155b42ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "f97e3c34e4a717ba6f3dbc66541b15fa4e5e1f497f1330c2ea793395011e726a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e6cb337-d297-4811-affe-e7e635a753bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c76270d013d76f8f88a8480de793373b9e5d8fe380912bfe01d4781641b1be7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The recorded reserves represent the Company\u2019s best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group ofclaims based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation.

For Global Lifestyle, the main product lines include extended service contracts,vehicle services contracts, mobile device protection and credit insurance. The main product lines for Global Housing include lender-placed homeowners and flood,Multifamily Housing and manufactured housing. For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. Theliability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claimsas of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to theCompany as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims.

This exposure arose from a short duration contract that the Company discontinued writing many years ago. The Company carries case reserves forthese liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and IBNR reserves. Estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation anduncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for determining theexposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition,the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.\nChanges in the estimated liabilities are recorded as a charge or credit to policyholder benefits as estimates are updated. Fees paid by the National FloodInsurance Program for processing and adjudication services are reported as a reduction of underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDebt \nThe Company reports debt net of acquisition costs, unamortized discount or premium and repurchases. Interest expense related to debt is expensed as incurred.See Note 18 for additional information.\nContingencies \nA loss contingency is recorded if reasonably estimable and probable. The Company establishes reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or if noone estimated amount within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimatedrange. Contingencies affecting the Company primarily relate to legal and regulatory matters, which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significantchanges.\nF-15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5270, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "975815e7-0748-4c0c-9a96-9d1c581e76c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "975815e7-0748-4c0c-9a96-9d1c581e76c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc7829e4-0e1c-4b9c-8843-183a3a095654", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "11d1ada2c3415f841938cd0c355dcc2f0faad85ad9b01c4f3b9595deaf1b87eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Other Liabilities\nWith respect to the deductible portion of a high deductible claim, the Company manages and pays the entire claim on behalf of the insured and is reimbursedby the insured for the deductible portion of the claim.

The allowance is based upon the Company\u2019s ongoing review of amountsoutstanding, length of collection periods, changes in insured credit standing and other relevant factors.\nRetirement of Treasury Stock\nThe Company accounts for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method. This method of accounting allocates the cost of repurchased andretired shares between paid-in capital and retained earnings by comparing the price of shares repurchased to the original issue proceeds of those shares. When therepurchase price of the shares is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings.

Mobile device protection and credit insurance are monthly policies and premium is earned on a monthly basis.\nPremiums for lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, and renters insurance are generally earned on a pro-rata basis over theterm of the policies, which are typically over twelve months.\nReinsurance reinstatement premiums are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premium and are netted against netearned premiums in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLong Duration Contracts \nPremiums for the Company\u2019s run-off blocks of long-term care insurance contracts are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal lifeinsurance, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. These premiums are ceded. \nFees and Other Income \nThe Company derives fees and other income from providing administrative services, mobile-related services and mortgage property risk management services.These fees are recognized as the services are performed. \nThe Company reports revenues related to long duration and short duration insurance contracts as premiums, including insurance contracts written by non-insurance affiliates, such as certain extended service contracts, consistent with the Company\u2019s principal business of insurance. Components of consideration paid bythe insured are generally not separated as fees and other income. However, when a component of the consideration paid by an insured both does not involve fulfillingthe insurance obligation (in that it does not involve acquisition, claims or other administrative aspects of the insurance contract) and the related service could havebeen written as a separate contract, it is reported in fees and other income.\nDealer obligor service contracts are sales in which an unaffiliated retailer/dealer is the obligor and the Company provides administrative services only. Forthese contract sales, the Company recognizes administrative fee revenue on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the service contract which correspond to the period inwhich the services are performed.\nThe unexpired portion of fee revenues are deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts.

The Company recognizes revenue as it invoices, which corresponds to the value transferred to the customer.\nThe Company also repairs, refurbishes and then sells mobile and other electronic devices, on behalf of its client, for a bundled per unit fee. The entireprocessing of the device is considered one performance obligation with a standalone selling price and thus, the per unit fee is recognized when the products are sold.Payments are generally due prior to shipment or within a short-term period.\nGlobal Housing\nIn the Global Housing segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Homeowners business.

These investments are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company\u2019smaximum exposure to loss is its recorded carrying value of $281.2 million and $249.1 million, respectively.

Fair Value Disclosures\nFair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures\n The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as theprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. TheCompany has categorized its recurring fair value basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to thevaluation technique.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority tounobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair valuehierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement in its entirety. The Company\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment andtakes into account factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n\u2022 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.\n\u2022 Level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantiallythe full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical orsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset or liability.The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset or liability.\n\u2022 Level 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any,market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect management\u2019s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use inpricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassificationof levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables present the Company\u2019s fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024and 2023. The amounts presented below for short-term investments, other investments, cash equivalents, other assets, assets held in and liabilities related to separateaccounts and other liabilities differ from the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets because only certain investments or certain assets and liabilitieswithin these line items are measured at estimated fair value. Other investments are comprised of investments in the AIP, the ASIC plan, and the ADC and otherderivatives. Other liabilities are comprised of investments in the AIP and other derivatives. The fair value amount and the majority of the associated levels presentedfor other investments and assets and liabilities held in separate accounts are received directly from third parties.\nF-32", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3643, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf8b77aa-3599-4a5c-ae15-ab5829179197": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf8b77aa-3599-4a5c-ae15-ab5829179197", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "AIZ 10K -

The threevaluation techniques described in the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance are consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies.\nThe market approach valuation techniques use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assetsor liabilities. When possible, quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets are used as of the period-end date (such as for mutual funds and money market funds).Otherwise, the Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market approach including matrix pricing and comparables. Matrix pricing is a mathematicaltechnique employed principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for those securities but, rather, relying on the securities\u2019relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Market approach valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables. Multiplesmight lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment,considering both qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement.\nIncome approach valuation techniques convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. Thesetechniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts as of the period-end date. Examples of income approach valuation techniques include present valuetechniques, option-pricing models, binomial or lattice models that incorporate present value techniques and the multi-period excess earnings method.\nCost approach valuation techniques are based upon the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset at the period-end date, or thecurrent replacement cost. That is, from the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the costto a market participant (buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.\nWhile not all three approaches are applicable to all financial assets or liabilities, where appropriate, the Company may use one or more valuation techniques.For all the classes of financial assets and liabilities included in the above hierarchy, excluding certain derivatives and certain privately placed corporate bonds, theCompany generally uses the market valuation technique.\nLevel 1 Securities\nThe Company\u2019s investments and liabilities classified as Level 1 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of mutual funds and related obligations, moneymarket funds and common stocks that are publicly listed and/or actively traded in an established market.\nLevel 2 Securities\nThe Company values Level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing service or asset manager.

The factors include:\n\u2022 whether there are few recent transactions,\n\u2022 whether little information is released publicly,\n\u2022 whether the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants,\n\u2022 whether the prices are stale (i.e., not current), and\n\u2022 the magnitude of the bid-ask spread.\nIlliquidity did not have a material impact in the fair value determination of the Company\u2019s financial assets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nThe Company generally obtains one price for each financial asset. The Company performs a periodic analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent areasonable estimate of the financial assets\u2019 fair values. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accountingprofessionals. Examples of procedures performed include initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from thepricing service, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness.Following this analysis, the Company generally uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. On infrequent occasions, a non-pricing servicesource may be more familiar with the market activity for a particular security than the pricing service. In these cases the price used is taken from the non-pricingservice source. The pricing service provides information to indicate which securities were priced using market observable inputs so that the Company can properlycategorize the Company\u2019s financial assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nDisclosures for Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company also measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, generally on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying amount of the assets may be affected. These assets include commercial mortgage loans, equity investments accounted for under the measurementalternative, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets.\nIn 2024 and 2023, as a result of third-party market observable transactions that were of the same issuer and determined to be similar, the Company markedcertain of its equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative to fair value. The carrying value of investments under the measurement alternativemarked to fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $26.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively. Given the significantunobservable inputs involved in valuation of these investments, they are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, these valuations utilize themarket approach, or an option pricing model backsolve method, which is a valuation approach that can be used to determine the value of common shares forcompanies with complex capital structures in which there have not been any recent transactions involving common shares. Inputs include capitalization tables,investment past and future performance projections, time to exit, discount rate and volatility based upon an appropriate industry group. For the year ended December31, 2024, the Company recorded fair value increases of $8.7 million related to five market observable transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2023, theCompany recorded fair value increases of $0.6 million related to one market observable transactions and a note conversion of two investments.\nIn 2024 and 2023, as a result of a qualitative analysis indicating an impairment existed, the Company performed a quantitative analysis utilizing a probabilityweighted scenario model and determined certain investments were impaired. Model inputs include capitalization tables, investment past and future companyperformance projections, and discount rate.

For fixedrate loans, the matrix process uses a yield buildup approach to create a pricing yield, with components for base yield, credit quality spread, property type spread, anda weighted average life spread. Floating rate loans are priced with a target quality spread over the swap curve. A dollar price for each loan is derived from the pricingyield or spread by a discounted cash flow methodology.\nOther investments: Other investments include low income housing tax credits, business debentures, and credit tenant loans which are recorded at cost oramortized cost, as well as policy loans. The carrying value reported for these investments approximates fair value.\nOther assets: The carrying value of dealer loans approximates fair value.\nPolicy reserves under investment products: The fair values for the Company\u2019s policy reserves under investment products are determined using discounted cashflow analysis. Key inputs to the valuation include projections of policy cash flows, reserve runoff, market yields and risk margins.\nFunds held under reinsurance: The carrying value reported approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.\nDebt: The fair value of debt is based upon matrix pricing performed by the pricing service utilizing the standard inputs.\nThe following tables disclose the carrying value, fair value and hierarchy level of the financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fairvalue in the consolidated balance sheets as of the dates indicated:\n December 31, 2024\n  Fair Value\n  Carrying Value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial Assets\nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate $ 342.5 $ 333.3 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 333.3 \nOther investments 23.2 23.2 1.3 \u2014 21.9 \nOther assets 26.3 26.3 \u2014 \u2014 26.3 \nTotal financial assets $ 392.0 $ 382.8 $ 1.3 $ \u2014 $ 381.5 \nFinancial Liabilities\nPolicy reserves under investment products (Individual and group annuities,subject to discretionary withdrawal) (1) $ 6.5 $ 6.9 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 6.9 \nFunds held under reinsurance 277.7 277.7 277.7 \u2014 \u2014 \nDebt 2,083.1 1,998.1 \u2014 1,998.1 \u2014 \nTotal financial liabilities $ 2,367.3 $ 2,282.7 $ 277.7 $ 1,998.1 $ 6.9 \nF-38", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2881, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d30f12-0efc-4c8b-a924-0dee1dd9962a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d30f12-0efc-4c8b-a924-0dee1dd9962a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7e665c6-408d-4c55-a001-7c865cee4e45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "883307ba34bf23a7c3e7534c39baac111d2ac637cff01e1ad777ad50e98afab0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "December 31, 2023\n  Fair Value\n  Carrying Value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial Assets\nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate $ 328.7 $ 313.7 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 313.7 \nOther investments 3.7 3.7 1.4 \u2014 2.3 \nOther assets 26.5 26.5 \u2014 \u2014 26.5 \nTotal financial assets $ 358.9 $ 343.9 $ 1.4 $ \u2014 $ 342.5 \nFinancial Liabilities\nPolicy reserves under investment products (Individual and group annuities,subject to discretionary withdrawal) (1) $ 7.3 $ 7.8 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 7.8 \nFunds held under reinsurance 392.7 392.7 392.7 \u2014 \u2014 \nDebt 2,080.6 1,972.4 \u2014 1,972.4 \u2014 \nTotal financial liabilities $ 2,480.6 $ 2,372.9 $ 392.7 $ 1,972.4 $ 7.8 \n(1) Only the fair value of the Company\u2019s policy reserves for investment-type contracts (those without significant mortality or morbidity risk) are reflected in the tables above.\n10.

In 2023, the Company reassessed its reporting units and determined that the Global Financial Services component shouldbe aggregated with other business components within the Connected Living reporting unit because the business is managed by the\nF-42", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3086, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3f2dbf9-0f15-4297-8bc4-d8c31ee004e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3f2dbf9-0f15-4297-8bc4-d8c31ee004e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fa3ba7c-1f23-4bc8-9ab5-b0380543588a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "96092e35485dfab2097812805cf857655cdd0b000b35803f78384b029b5d6b00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "same business leader and have similar economic characteristics as required by the aggregation criteria. The new combined Connected Living reporting unit meets theaccounting definition of a single reporting unit.\nQualitative Impairment Testing\nFor the annual October 1, 2024 goodwill impairment test, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for all reporting units with goodwill (ConnectedLiving, Global Automotive and Global Housing) due to high margins between fair value and book value based on quantitative impairment testing in 2023. Inconducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzed changes in the book value and the financial performance of each reporting unit, including analyzing thehistorical performance versus plan and the results of quantitative impairment testing performed in 2023. Additionally, the Company assessed critical areas that mayimpact the reporting units, including macroeconomic and industry trends and market information for the reporting units and their peer companies that could impactthe reporting units\u2019 fair value. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units\u2019 fair values were more thantheir respective book values and therefore quantitative impairment testing was not necessary for Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing.\nQuantitative Impairment Testing\nFor the annual October 1, 2023 goodwill impairment test, the Company performed quantitative tests for all reporting units with goodwill (Connected Living,Global Automotive and Global Housing).\nThe following describes the various valuation methodologies used in the quantitative test which were weighted using our judgment as to which were the mostrepresentative in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units.\nA Dividend Discount Method (\u201cDDM\u201d) was used to value each of the reporting units based upon the present value of expected cash flows available fordistribution over future periods. Cash flows were estimated for a discrete projection period based on detailed assumptions, and a terminal value was calculated toreflect the value attributable to cash flows beyond the discrete period. Cash flows and the terminal value were then discounted using each reporting unit\u2019s estimatedcost of capital. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit represented the sum of the discounted cash flows and terminal value.\nA Guideline Company Method, in which we identified a group of peer companies that have similar operations to the reporting unit, was used; however, directpeer comparisons for the reporting units were limited given the diversity of the products and services within the businesses. This method was used to value eachreporting unit based upon its relative performance to peer companies, based on several measures, including price to trailing 12-month earnings, price to projectedearnings, price to tangible net worth and return on equity.\nWhile DDM and Guideline Company valuation methodologies were considered in assessing fair value, the DDM was weighted more heavily sincemanagement believes that expected cash flows are the most important factor in the valuation of a business enterprise, and also considering the lack of directly-comparable peer companies. Based on the quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2023, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of theConnected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing reporting units exceeded their respective book values and therefore determined that the assigned goodwillwas not impaired.\nSharing Economy and Small Commercial Businesses Impairment\nIn second quarter of 2022, $7.8 million of goodwill, previously included in Global Housing, was allocated to the sharing economy and small commercialbusinesses which are included within non-core operations in Corporate and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified impairment indicatorsimpacting the fair value of the sharing economy and small commercial businesses, including a decline in long-term economic performance. The fair value of thesharing economy and small commercial businesses was determined using a discounted cash flow method which calculated the present value of the run-off results andconsidered all aspects of the business including investment assumptions. The fair value calculated in the fourth quarter of 2022 was lower than the carrying value ofthe run-off businesses, resulting in the pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of the entire goodwill of $7.8 million. The goodwill impairment charge was reportedseparately in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, with a corresponding reduction to goodwill in the consolidatedbalance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nF-43", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4796, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c46b4c79-5f3c-4587-a942-63dad40c7fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "c46b4c79-5f3c-4587-a942-63dad40c7fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b0f85804-43d5-469c-9b61-ff4446bada99", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "969e400d69792ba1545df06734eeb3e4d658a12701206d26cb0237acb7fd3f78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A roll forward of goodwill by reportable segment is provided below as of and for the years indicated:\nGlobal Lifestyle (1) Global Housing Corporate and Other Consolidated\nBalance at December 31, 2022 (2) $ 2,193.9 $ 409.1 $ \u2014 $ 2,603.0 \nTransfers (3) 92.4 (92.4) \u2014 \u2014 \nForeign currency translation and other 5.8 \u2014 \u2014 5.8 \nBalance at December 31, 2023 (2) 2,292.1 316.7 \u2014 2,608.8 \nAcquisitions 11.4 \u2014 \u2014 11.4 \nForeign currency translation and other (4.2) \u2014 \u2014 (4.2)\nBalance at December 31, 2024 (2) $ 2,299.3 $ 316.7 $ \u2014 $ 2,616.0 \n(1) As of December 31, 2024, $793.6 million and $1,505.7 million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living and Global Automotive reporting units, respectively.

Ultimate loss andloss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. The reserving methods employed by the Company include theChain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Reportable catastrophe losses are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequencyand severity approach. The methods involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each productgrouping. As the data ages, loss development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting lossdevelopment factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period.

For certain categories of claims and for reinsurance recoverables, losses may sometimes bereclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. These reclassifications are shownas development in the respective years in the tables below. Predominantly, the Company writes short-tail lines that are written on an occurrence basis. Fiveyears of claims development information is provided since most of the claims are fully developed after five years, as shown in the average payout ratiotables.\n\u2022 Table Groupings: The groupings have homogeneous risk characteristics with similar development patterns and would generally be subject to similar trendsand reflect our reportable segments.\n\u2022 Impact of Reinsurance: The reinsurance program varies by exposure type. Historically, the Company has leveraged facultative and treaty reinsurance, bothon pro-rata and excess of loss basis. The reinsurance program may change from year to year, which may affect the comparability of the data presented in thetables.\n\u2022 IBNR: Includes development from past reported losses in IBNR.\n\u2022 Information excluded from tables: Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are excluded from the tables.\n\u2022 Foreign exchange rates: The loss development for operations outside of the U.S. is presented for all accident years using the current exchange rates atDecember 31, 2024. Although this approach requires restating all prior accident year information, the changes in exchange rates do not impact incurred andpaid loss development trends.\n\u2022 Acquisitions: Includes acquisitions from all accident years presented in the tables. For purposes of this disclosure, we have applied the retrospectivemethod for the acquired reserves, including incurred and paid claim development histories throughout the relevant tables. It should be noted that historicalreserves for the acquired business were established by the acquired companies using methods, assumptions and procedures then in effect which may differfrom our current reserving bases.

The payout levels can vary between 0% and 200% (maximum) of the target (100%) ALTEIP award amount, based on theCompany\u2019s level of performance against the selected metrics. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance period based on a target payout and will bepaid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the actual number of shares issued.\nThe Compensation Committee has established two equally weighted performance measures for PSU awards:\n\u2022 Total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index (\u201cmarket condition\u201d), defined as appreciation in the Company\u2019s common stock plus dividend yield tostockholders and will be measured by the performance of the Company relative to the S&P 500 Index over the three-year performance period.\n\u2022 Adjusted earnings per diluted common share, excluding reportable catastrophes (\u201cperformance condition\u201d) is a Company-specific profitability metric and isdefined as the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, divided by the fully diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.This metric is an absolute metric that is measured against a three-year cumulative target established by the Compensation Committee at the award date andis not tied to the performance of peer companies. Prior to 2023, net operating income per diluted common share, excluding reportable catastrophes, wasused as the company specific profitability metric.\nA summary of the Company\u2019s outstanding PSUs is presented below:\nPerformanceShare Units\nWeighted-AverageGrant-DateFair Value\nPerformance share units outstanding at December 31, 2023 598,755 $ 151.63 \nGrants (1) 188,407 207.00 \nVests (2) (220,055) 147.85 \nPerformance adjustment (3) 28,890 146.19 \nForfeitures and adjustments (10,491) 165.01 \nPerformance share units outstanding at December 31, 2024 585,506 $ 170.44 \n(1) The weighted average grant date fair value for PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022 was $114.91 and $217.33, respectively.(2) The total fair value of PSUs vested was $39.8 million, $25.8 million and $42.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.(3) Represents the change in PSUs issued based upon the attainment of performance goals established by the Company.\nPSU grants above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the Company\u2019s level of performance againstthe selected metrics to be determined at the end of the prospective performance period.\nThe fair value of the performance condition was estimated using the fair market value of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant. The fairvalue of the market condition was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple variables that determine theprobability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award.

The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, through payroll deductions, portions of their after-tax compensation in each offeringperiod toward the purchase of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There are two offering periods during the year (January 1 through June 30 and July 1 throughDecember 31) and shares of common stock are purchased at the end of each offering period at 90% of the lower of the closing price of the common stock on the firstor last day of the offering period. Participants must be employed on the last trading day of the offering period in order to purchase shares of common stock under theESPP. The maximum number of shares of common stock that can be purchased is 5,000 per employee. Participants\u2019 contributions are limited to a maximumcontribution of $7.5 thousand per offering period, or $15.0 thousand per year.\nThe ESPP is offered to individuals who are scheduled to work a certain number of hours per week, have been continuously employed for at least six months bythe start of the offering period, are not temporary employees (classified as temporary and employed less than 12 months) and have not been on a leave of absence formore than 90 days immediately preceding the offering period.\nIn January 2025, the Company issued 50,763 shares of common stock at a discounted price of $150.20 for the offering period of July 1, 2024 throughDecember 31, 2024. In January 2024, the Company issued 65,049 shares of common stock at a discounted price of $113.26 for the offering period of July 1, 2023through December 31, 2023.\nIn July 2024, the Company issued 49,969 shares of common stock to employees at a discounted price of $149.63 for the offering period of January 1, 2024through June 30, 2024. In July 2023, the Company issued 66,306 shares of common stock to employees at a discounted price of $113.15 for the offering period ofJanuary 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023.\nThe compensation expense recorded related to the ESPP was $2.8 million, $3.1 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and2022, respectively. The related income tax benefit for disqualified disposition was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 0.1 million for the yearsended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe fair value of each award under the ESPP was estimated at the beginning of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model andassumptions in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company\u2019s common stock and the historicalvolatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe time of grant.

Statutory Information\nThe Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries prepare financial statements in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles (\u201cSAP\u201d) prescribed or permitted by theinsurance departments of their states of domicile. Prescribed SAP includes the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) as well as state laws, regulations and administrative rules.\nThe principal differences between SAP and GAAP are: (1) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, but are deferred and amortized underGAAP; (2) VOBA is not capitalized under SAP but is under GAAP; (3) the classification and carrying amounts of investments in certain securities are differentunder SAP than under GAAP; (4) the criteria for providing asset valuation allowances, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are differentunder SAP than under GAAP; (5) the timing of establishing certain reserves, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are different under SAPthan under GAAP; (6) certain assets are not admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP; (7) methodologies used to determine the amounts of deferredtaxes, intangible assets and goodwill are different under SAP than under GAAP; and (8) the criteria for obtaining reinsurance accounting treatment is different underSAP than under GAAP, and SAP allows net presentation of insurance reserves and reinsurance recoverables.\nF-64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2811, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35d07ffa-239a-4588-9913-2dac25c981ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "35d07ffa-239a-4588-9913-2dac25c981ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9c03008-770c-4202-8075-51b9da5b3400", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "1ac633012b81129ecaa363135384b5a3ce98a37bbb1aa7f048b8c1eefc313333", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The combined statutory net income, excluding intercompany dividends and surplus note interest, and capital and surplus of the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciledstatutory insurance subsidiaries is as follows: \n Years Ended December 31,\n 2024 2023 2022\nProperty and casualty companies $ 546.0 $ 529.4 $ 283.5 \nLife and health companies 22.2 13.7 20.0 \nTotal statutory net income $ 568.2 $ 543.1 $ 303.5 \n December 31,\n 2024 2023\nProperty and casualty companies $ 1,642.8 $ 1,461.4 \nLife and health companies 85.5 87.6 \nTotal statutory capital and surplus $ 1,728.3 $ 1,549.0 \nThe Company also has non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries that are not subject to SAP. The statutory net income and statutory capitaland surplus amounts presented above do not include non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries in accordance with SAP.\nInsurance enterprises are required by state insurance departments to adhere to minimum risk-based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) requirements developed by the NAIC. TheCompany\u2019s insurance subsidiaries expect to exceed minimum RBC requirements as of December 31, 2024. In addition, all of our rated insurance subsidiariescurrently maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A.\nThe payment of dividends to the Company by any of the Company\u2019s regulated U.S domiciled insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e.,extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatoryapproval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of the jurisdictions inwhich the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year\u2019s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year.Some jurisdictions limit ordinary dividends to the greater of these two amounts, others limit them to the lesser of these two amounts and some jurisdictions excludeprior year realized capital gains from prior year net income in determining ordinary dividend capacity. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation thatdividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by the Company\u2019sinsurance subsidiaries to the Company (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse topolicyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Based on the dividend restrictionsunder applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay to the Company in2025 without regulatory approval is approximately $524.2 million. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the abilityof the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.\n23. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (\u201cAssurant Pension Plan\u201d) covering substantially allemployees. The Assurant Pension Plan is considered \u201cqualified\u201d because it meets the requirements of IRC Section 401(a) (\u201cIRC 401(a)\u201d) and the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). The Assurant Pension Plan is a pension equity plan with a grandfathered final average earningsplan for a certain group of employees. Benefits are based on certain years of service and the employee\u2019s compensation during certain such years of service. TheCompany\u2019s funding policy is to contribute amounts to the Assurant Pension Plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements in ERISA, plus suchadditional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time up to the maximum permitted. The funding policy considers several factorsto determine such additional amounts, including items such as the amount of service cost plus 15% of the Assurant Pension Plan deficit and the capital position ofthe Company. During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan. Due to the Assurant Pension Plan\u2019s currentfunding status, no contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan are expected during the year ending December 31, 2025. Assurant Pension Plan assets are maintained ina separate trust. Assurant Pension Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company also has various non-contributory, non-qualified supplemental plans covering certain employees including the Assurant Executive Pension Planand the Assurant Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the \u201cSERP\u201d).

OnJuly 1, 2011, the Company terminated certain Retirement Health Benefits for employees who did not qualify for \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status and no longer offers thesebenefits to new hires. The Company contribution, plan design and other terms of the remaining benefits did not change for those grandfathered employees. TheCompany has the right to modify or terminate these benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2014, the Pension Benefits plans were closed to new hires.

Theremeasurement resulted in a reduction to the Retirement Health Benefits obligations of $65.6 million and a corresponding prior service credit in AOCI.

The methodology for selecting the discount rate was to match each Plan\u2019s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields onzero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis was comprised of 341 bonds rated AA by either Moody\u2019s or S&P\u2019swith maturities between zero and 30 years. The discount rate for each Plan is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. The Companyutilizes a split rate approach for purposes of determining the benefit obligations and service cost as well as a spot rate approach for the calculation of interest on theseitems in the determination of the net periodic benefit cost.\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments(primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectationsfor future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to beinvested. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the targeted asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assetassumptions for the portfolio. The Company believes the current assumption reflects the projected return on the invested assets, given the current market conditionsand the modified portfolio structure. Actual return (loss) on Plan assets was 1.7%, 5.6% and (16.9)% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022respectively.\nF-68", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3288, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12b75c31-1412-4cf3-bf78-765c5fa38871": {"__data__": {"id_": "12b75c31-1412-4cf3-bf78-765c5fa38871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6281e37-d038-4b84-a27e-b3d23a8449e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "da3c826f09d435e4c03693aae29ee2b6696784d4d01fc9f68245104015669256", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost were as follows: \n Retirement Health Benefits\n 2024 2023 2022\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year (1):\nPre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan N/A 5.6% 5.4%\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical) N/A 4.0% 4.2%\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Rx) N/A 7.0% 6.6%\nPre-65 Reimbursement Plan N/A 5.5% 5.4%\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan N/A 5.5% 5.4%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) (1) N/A 4.0% 4.0%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate (1)\nPre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan N/A 2045 2045\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical & Rx) N/A 2045 2045\nPre-65 Reimbursement Plan N/A 2045 2045\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan N/A 2045 2045\n(1) The Retirement Health Benefits Plan terminated effective December 31, 2024. Since the plan has terminated, there are no costs to bring forward to the following year so none of the trend rates areapplicable for 2024.\nThe assets of the Plans are managed to maximize their long-term pre-tax investment return, subject to the following dual constraints: minimization of requiredcontributions and maintenance of solvency requirements. It is anticipated that periodic contributions to the Plans will, for the foreseeable future, be sufficient to meetbenefit payments thus allowing the balance to be managed according to a long-term approach. The Benefit Plans Investment Committee (\u201cBPIC\u201d) for the Plansmeets on a quarterly basis and reviews the re-balancing of existing fund assets and the asset allocation of new fund contributions.\nThe goal of the Company\u2019s asset strategy is to ensure that the growth in the value of the Plans\u2019 assets over the long-term, both in real and nominal terms,manages (controls) risk exposure. Risk is managed by investing in a broad range of asset classes, and within those asset classes, a broad range of individualsecurities. Diversification by asset classes stabilizes total results over short-term time periods. Each asset class is externally managed by outside investmentmanagers appointed by the BPIC. Derivatives may be used consistent with the Plans\u2019 investment objectives established by the BPIC. All securities must be U.S.Dollar denominated.\nThe BPIC oversees the investment of the Plans\u2019 assets and periodically reviews the investment strategies, strategic asset allocation, liabilities and portfoliostructure of the assets. After a 2017 review and considering the funded status of the Assurant Pension Plan, the BPIC transitioned plan assets to a new target assetallocation consisting of 80% fixed income, 10% real estate, 5% hedge funds and 5% equities.\nThe assets of the Plans are primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Interest rate risk is hedged by aligning the duration of the fixed maturity securitieswith the duration of the liabilities. Specifically, interest rate swaps can be used if needed to synthetically extend the duration of fixed maturity securities to match theduration of the liabilities, as measured on a projected benefit obligation basis. In addition, the Plans\u2019 fixed income securities have exposure to credit risk. In order toadequately diversify and limit exposure to credit risk, the BPIC established parameters which include a limit on the asset types that managers are permitted topurchase, maximum exposure limits by sector and by individual issuer (based on asset quality) and minimum required ratings on individual securities. As ofDecember 31, 2024, 87% of plan assets were invested in fixed maturity securities and 18%, 17% and 11% of those securities were concentrated in the energy andpower, finance and real estate, and communication industries, respectively, with no exposure to any single creditor in excess of 4%, 5% and 13% of those industries,respectively. As of December 31, 2024, 5% of plan assets were invested in equity securities and 100% of the Plans\u2019 equity securities were invested in a mutual fundthat attempts to replicate the return of the S&P 500 Index by investing its assets in large capitalization stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index using aweighting similar to the S&P 500 Index. The remainder of the assets are invested in real estate and other alternative assets.\nF-69", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4316, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fd5d7ba-b3f8-498c-91a4-8fa339e3c966": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fd5d7ba-b3f8-498c-91a4-8fa339e3c966", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a636e064-7c4a-4c63-ac8e-e3b29f0ad37f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "62d68c91c38c12dd7d60b6cf0116a89feb5793759ce165bdc0da712ab34bb04c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The fair value hierarchy for the Company\u2019s qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2024 by asset category, is asfollows:\nQualified Pension Benefits December 31, 2024\nFinancial Assets Total Level 1 Level 2\nCash equivalents:\nShort-term investment funds $ 7.8 $ \u2014 $ 7.8 \nEquity securities:\nMutual funds - U.S. listed large cap 29.2 29.2 \u2014 \nFixed maturity securities:\nU.S. & foreign government and government agencies and authorities 144.0 \u2014 144.0 \nCorporate - U.S. & foreign investment grade 334.7 \u2014 334.7 \nCorporate - U.S. & foreign high yield 10.9 \u2014 10.9 \nMutual funds - U.S. investment grade 14.4 14.4 \u2014 \nOther investments measured at net asset value (1) 106.6 \u2014 \u2014 \nTotal financial assets (2) $ 647.6 $ 43.6 $ 497.4 \n(1) In accordance with fair value measurements and disclosures guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient have not been classified in thefair value hierarchy.

A quarterly analysis is performed to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of theirfair value. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by benefits, investment and accounting professionals. Examples of proceduresperformed include initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certainsecurities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness. Following this analysis, the Company uses the best estimate of fair value based upon allavailable inputs. The pricing service provides information regarding their pricing procedures so that the Company can properly categorize the Plans\u2019 financial assetsin the fair value hierarchy.\nF-71", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4023, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1108acb-7652-448a-b469-3c356b2e8053": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1108acb-7652-448a-b469-3c356b2e8053", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "253c34ae-a7c5-45be-bbae-0108de269d57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/camyoung/Documents/Projects/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AIZ 10K - 2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2648554, "creation_date": "2025-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-04"}, "hash": "791ed666411ee12ae671d4fffcf2860d7958b9e2aaf1d7e9acea0ec4adc4641d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The following pension benefits are expected to be paid over the next ten-year period:\nPensionBenefits\nRetirementHealthBenefits\n2025 $ 49.6 $ 0.1 \n2026 49.7 0.1 \n2027 48.2 0.1 \n2028 48.1 \u2014 \n2029 48.1 \u2014 \n2030 - 2034 215.3 0.3 \nTotal $ 459.0 $ 0.6 \nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.

Restructuring and Related Impairment Charges\nIn December 2022, the Company finalized its plan to realize greater efficiencies by continuing to simplify its business portfolio and leverage its globalfootprint to reduce costs. This included realigning its organizational structure and talent to support its business strategy (the \u201ctransformational plan\u201d). The Companyalso accelerated its ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given its increasingly hybrid workforce (the \u201creturn to workstrategy\u201d).\nIn September 2023, the Company amended and extended the December 2022 plan to include additional actions within the initiatives described above, includingfurther consolidation of its real estate portfolio and additional changes to its organizational structure. The Company now expects to complete these actions in 2025.\nThe following table summarizes the costs by major type that are recorded in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidatedstatement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative costs incurred as of December 31, 2024 and the estimated total costsincurred.

The Company had $1.8 million and $2.9 millionof letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is involved in a variety of litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its current and past business operations and, from time totime, it may become involved in other such actions. The Company continues to defend itself vigorously in these proceedings. The Company has participated andmay participate in settlements on terms that the Company considers reasonable.\nThe Company has established an accrued liability for certain legal and regulatory proceedings. The possible loss or range of loss resulting from such litigationand regulatory proceedings, if any, in excess of the amounts accrued is inherently unpredictable and uncertain. Consequently, no reasonable estimate can be made ofany possible loss or range of loss in excess of the accrual. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending legal or regulatory proceeding, or thepotential losses, fines, penalties or equitable relief, if any, that may result, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019sconsolidated results of operations or cash flows for an individual reporting period. However, on the basis of currently available information, management does notbelieve that the pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n27. Subsequent Events\nThe California Wildfires began in January 2025, causing significant damage throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area and surrounding regions. At thetime of this filing, the claims process continues and our current view is that reportable catastrophes from the California Wildfires are expected to approach or slightlyexceed our catastrophe reinsurance program per event retention of $150 million. There is inherent variability in our estimates of early loss projections and claimsseverity, and therefore the estimate may change as additional information emerges.\nF-74", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3749, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a48d355-38c8-4c20-816e-b119125f3958": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a48d355-38c8-4c20-816e-b119125f3958", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "AIZ 10K -

Our certificate of incorporation, which provides for the issuance of preferred stock, may have the effect of delaying,deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of theholders of shares of common stock. Further, our certificate of incorporation requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must beeffected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing. Special meetings of our stockholders may becalled only by our Chief Executive Officer or by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by the board of directors. In addition, our by-laws establishadvance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without further action of our stockholders, to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, inone or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The issuance of preferred stock on various termscould adversely affect the holders of common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may discourage bids for shares of our common stock at a premiumover the market price of our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock and may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol of the Company.\nThe anti-takeover and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent achange in control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policiesformulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions aredesigned to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxyfights. However, these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibitfluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. These provisions also may have the effect of preventingchanges in our management.\nDelaware General Corporation Law. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 203\u201d).
