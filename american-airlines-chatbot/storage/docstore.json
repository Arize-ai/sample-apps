How is American responding? \nSafety is always at the forefront of everything we do at American, and it\u2019s part of my job \nevery day. When American first developed it, our Safety Management System literally set \nthe standard for our industry, and it continues to guide how we rigorously and consistently \nintegrate safety across our operations. We know safety is about systems and execution, but \nall of that really starts with a strong safety culture. Our top safety leaders come to the role \nwith deep experience working on the front line, with the professional certifications those \nroles require. They understand what good safety practices look like on the ground. And we \nmake clear to every team member that safety is everyone\u2019s responsibility, that it\u2019s their duty \nto report any safety concerns \u2014 and they will never face any repercussions for doing so. \nAviation is by far the safest mode of transportation in the world, and we are dedicated to \nkeeping it that way.\nHow do you think about operational performance  \nin the context of sustainability? \nFirst, it\u2019s important to remember that American is just one part of a broader supply \nchain that delivers travel \u2014 the airframe and engine manufacturers, fuel suppliers and \ngovernment agencies that control the airspace are all critical parts \u2014 and making \nour industry more efficient and sustainable needs to be a joint effort. For example, \nimproving how we use the airspace will help us operate more efficiently, save time for our \npassengers and reduce our emissions. That\u2019s why we advocate on behalf of our industry \nfor more investment in the Federal Aviation Administration.\nWithin our own operations, American\u2019s ability to deliver on our sustainability goals depends \non us continuing to run a reliable operation and thriving as a profitable enterprise. We remain \nlaser focused on being the most reliable airline possible \u2014  \none that delivers for our customers day in and day out. \nIn 2023, we recorded our best full-year completion \nfactor, with the lowest number of cancellations annually \nsince 2013. Thanks to that, along with a host of other \nefforts we have underway to enhance the travel \nexperience, we also posted company-record customer \nsatisfaction scores for the year.\nOur job is to get every one of our passengers safely \nto their destination \u2014 on schedule and with their \nbaggage in tow, to the very best of our ability. But, \nequally, it\u2019s to get every one of our team members \nhome safely at the end of their workday. As we\u2019ve \nramped up operations and onboarded new team \nmembers \u2014 fully a quarter of the team is new to \nAmerican since the pandemic \u2014 we\u2019ve redoubled our \nfocus on workplace safety, including by launching \na new companywide safety awareness training \nprogram and strengthening our training for new \nhires. Protecting the safety of our people is our \nforemost priority. Among all the competing demands \nof running an airline, safety always wins for us. \n\u201cAviation is widely recognized as one of \nthe most difficult sectors to decarbonize. \nGetting there is going to require action \nand investment across the public and \nprivate sectors and, quite frankly, that\u2019s not \nhappening at the pace or scale we need.\u201d\n3\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3747, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "708812d3-f3b6-424e-98d2-67a6fcba1ff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "708812d3-f3b6-424e-98d2-67a6fcba1ff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6205a14d-7ea3-4423-b5a0-f4b7133e193c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "86713190e6c39f28e20cd8374c4a0ec5b04b73a5940de59aeae24128e5de3dac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "24ae3163-4764-4ecb-a928-175c39b6b43b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3e657a9b8d9afb0a198d53f5709e425f9e9e2bf93f7f6ba499e15ce6eac9beb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "What do you see as American\u2019s biggest sustainability challenge?\nOur ability to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThere\u2019s no question we need to decarbonize aviation, and American\u2019s goal to achieve \nnet zero GHG emissions by 2050 is the right one. We are taking concrete steps within \nour operations and pulling all the levers we can control to drive progress. This includes \nundertaking the most extensive fleet renewal effort in the history of our industry to \ngive us the youngest mainline fleet among U.S. network carriers. We\u2019re also working \nand investing to help advance the technologies designed to deliver viable and scalable \ndecarbonization solutions over time.\nBut the reality is the action we can take within our own operations \u2014 or the scale of \ninvestment we can absorb in our low-margin business \u2014 will never be sufficient on \nits own. Government has a crucial role to play in facilitating the transition through \nsmart policies, incentives and investments in R&D. Industry, in partnership with \nacademia, needs to turn its focus to developing new commercial-scale decarbonization \ntechnologies. And innovation and policy need to work hand-in-hand. Aviation is widely \nrecognized as one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. Getting there is going to \nrequire action and investment across the public and private sectors and, quite frankly, \nthat\u2019s not happening at the pace or scale we need.\nCan you give an example?\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a perfect example. American has a goal to use 10% \nSAF in 2030. In 2023, we used 2.7 million gallons of SAF \u2014 the most we\u2019ve used in a \nsingle year \u2014 but it was still less than 1%. That wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. We\u2019ve signed \ncommitments with multiple SAF producers, at a premium, to try to secure supply and, in \nthe case of Infinium, to help attract capital to bring a new, lower-carbon SAF technology \nto market sooner. But the volume of SAF available today and likely to be ready over the \nnext several years is a tiny fraction of what\u2019s needed.\nCompared to other, not-yet-fully proven technologies to reduce the climate impacts of \naviation, SAF is a no-brainer. It\u2019s a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used by the aircraft flying \ntoday without modifications, that provides significant life cycle emission reductions. Scaling \nthe SAF market so fuel is available at the volume and price needed to make a real dent \nin aviation\u2019s climate impacts \u2014 and to help American reach our climate goals \u2014 depends \non bolder action by policymakers, increased investment by energy companies and more \ninnovative financing approaches. We\u2019ve seen progress \u2014 the recently enacted SAF blenders \ntax credit and similar efforts in states like Illinois are key steps forward \u2014 but we need more.\nThe development of new, more fuel-efficient engines and airframes is another example. \nGame-changing technologies like hydrogen \u2014 which American is also helping advance \u2014 \nare expected to be important elements of the long-term solution for decarbonizing aviation. \nBut to get from here to there, we need manufacturers to invest in the incremental but \nmeaningful advances in airframe and engine technologies that can come online with the \nnext generation of aircraft.\nIt\u2019s a risk for me to come out and say that American\u2019s ability to achieve our 2030, 2035 \nand 2050 climate goals is in jeopardy. But in my mind, the bigger risk is failing to sound \nthe alarm that there\u2019s an urgent need for more and faster action across the public and \nprivate sectors. American is doing its part, but we can\u2019t do it on our own.\nLet\u2019s end on a positive note. What are you most proud of from the last year?\nThat\u2019s easy. Our more than 140,000 team members. It\u2019s their hard work and dedication \nthat will help us reach our goals \u2014 be that financial, operational or on climate. Thanks to \nthem, I\u2019m confident that we can.\nAcross every level of our organization, we seek out the broadest and most diverse pool \nof talent available because we know that opening the doors to opportunity benefits our \nbusiness, allowing us to recruit the best and our team members to do their best work. \nWe\u2019re investing in developing the talent we need while raising awareness of and expanding \naccess to careers in aviation.

In early 2024, at the request of the Climate Change \nSteering Committee, the Sustainability team established a cross-functional working \ngroup focused on preparing to implement emerging climate-related regulatory disclosure \nrequirements applicable to American. \nResponsibility for specific climate-related issues is embedded in senior roles across \nour company. For example, the Operations team conducts resiliency planning for more \nfrequent and severe weather events, our Fuel Procurement team works to secure cost-\neffective supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and our Flight Operations and Fleet \nEngineering teams are focused on improving fuel efficiency in the air and on the ground. \nClimate-related risk management\nThrough our existing enterprise-wide risk management process, American monitors \nand manages a broad range of strategic, financial and operational risks, including \nrisks associated with climate change. To inform our understanding of the climate risk \nlandscape, we conducted an initial forward-looking climate scenario analysis in 2020 that \nfocused on identifying and assessing the physical and transition climate-related risks \nand opportunities facing the company over the short, medium and long term. In 2022 and \nearly 2023, we continued to build on this by undertaking a more detailed analysis of these \nrisks and opportunities. This included adding 1.5\u00b0C climate scenarios into our assessment, \nas well as expanding the number of sites included in the physical risk evaluation, \nexploring geographic regions around the world in which we operate that are projected to \nexperience greater impacts, and examining more closely the effects of potential changes \nin policy, technologies and markets.\nThe insights from this process, conducted in alignment with the recommendations \nof TCFD, continue to inform our climate strategy and are enabling us to more deeply \nintegrate climate risk analysis into our ongoing risk management and business, strategy \nand financial planning processes. For details, see page 61.\nPublic Policy and Political Contributions\nPolitical, legislative and regulatory decisions can have a significant impact on \nAmerican\u2019s success, and we have adopted policies that guide our participation \nin these processes. Reflecting best practices, our Statement on Public Policy \nEngagement and Political Participation describes how management and the \nBoard of Directors oversee American\u2019s public policy engagement and the policy \nconsiderations that influence such engagement. \nWe do not use corporate funds to contribute to candidates, political party \ncommittees or political action committees. On the rare occasion when we use \ncorporate funds to contribute to a state or local ballot initiative or a 501(c)(4) \norganization, we have committed to disclosing that contribution. In 2023, we \nmade a $1,500 contribution to Coalition for a Better 2050 in support of a ballot \ninitiative in North Carolina.\nThe CGPR Committee oversees the company\u2019s major advocacy priorities and \nactivities, political contributions and principal trade association memberships. \nWe are committed to aligning our lobbying efforts with the priorities and goals of \nthe Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change.\nFor more information on American\u2019s policies and procedures \nrelated to corporate governance and risk, as well as our \nStandards of Business Conduct, please see our website.\n8\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4295, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67817ba2-afc7-47de-9d23-e487a30403cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "67817ba2-afc7-47de-9d23-e487a30403cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82a7096d-8f84-4e9d-8b9d-6d8550e08977", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "4d5db15dc917d64e6870ae4a96689ff6f5b4406b38d1471f8932236acc19d8d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "IN CONVERSATION: \nA Director\u2019s View on Business and Society \nMarty Nesbitt is a founding Partner and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Vistria, LLC, a \nprivate investment firm focused on building market-leading companies in the healthcare, \nknowledge and learning, and financial services industries. He serves on American\u2019s Board \nof Directors and chairs the Board\u2019s CGPR Committee. In early 2024, Marty shared his \nperspective on harnessing the private sector to drive social and environmental progress. \nYour firm, Vistria, makes private sector investments aimed at delivering both \nfinancial returns and societal impact. How should companies think about \ndelivering on those two objectives?\nCapitalism and democracy form the greatest socioeconomic construct in the history of \nthe world. But they\u2019re not perfect, and they\u2019re not science \u2014 humans invented them. The \nworld has never been safer or more prosperous than it is today, but there are still lots of \nproblems that we have to solve. \nSince we invented this construct, we can make it better, right? Companies are realizing \ntheir profitability and performance are tied to their good behavior in these areas. \nInstitutional investors are recognizing they can\u2019t meet their long-term obligations to \ntheir constituents if people aren\u2019t healthy or don\u2019t have the resources to buy products \nand services, or if the air and water aren\u2019t clean. I think of this as using capitalism\u2019s own \nincentives to drive better social and environmental performance \u2014 like doing jujitsu on \ncapitalism. For business, it\u2019s in our long-term interest to figure out how to strengthen \nand nurture society. \nHow does that translate into what American Airlines does day to day?\nEvery company, given what it does and sells and its inputs, has a unique opportunity \nin how it can be impactful and also make that a competitive advantage. For American, \nits product and service itself makes a profound impact in connecting people. \nThat strengthens our souls and makes us better and more productive parts of our \ncommunities. It also drives economic growth and expands opportunity.\nBut we\u2019re also in an industry that produces a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. So the \nwork we\u2019re doing to minimize our carbon footprint \u2014 by helping advance the SAF  \nmarket or the science on contrail avoidance, for example \u2014 is necessary and it makes  \na difference. The same goes for our investments in developing our employees and \ncreating a constructive and positive culture. It\u2019s vital for our business, and a powerful \ncontributor to the strength and stability of our communities.\nWhat else is needed to solve today\u2019s challenges?\nClearly, American is not going to be able to singularly address the climate impact of \naviation, close the wealth gap or solve the many other problems we face alone. If every \ncompany moves toward the better end, that has a profound impact across the ecosystem. \nBut we need more.

Our strategy to reach these targets focuses on running an ever \nmore fuel-efficient operation, primarily by operating more fuel-efficient aircraft that are \nincreasingly powered by low-carbon fuel.\nWhile we are committed to taking steps within our own operations, the reality is that we \ncannot rely on today\u2019s technologies to achieve the progress we need to make in reducing \nour emissions in the future. Making the transition to low- and no-carbon aviation depends \non a range of technologies that are not yet at commercial scale \u2014 or haven\u2019t yet been \ninvented. That\u2019s why a key part of our climate strategy is collaborating with business \npartners, startups, scientists and innovators who are pioneering these technologies. \nThose collaborations, in turn, are driving our investments and catalytic commitments to \nhelp advance and scale aviation\u2019s decarbonization solutions. \nOur Climate Strategy\nOur aim is to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. To drive progress, we have set an \nintermediate target to reduce GHG emissions intensity by 45% by 2035, relative to a 2019 \nbaseline. This includes both direct emissions (Scope 1) \u2014 primarily from the combustion \nof jet fuel used in flight \u2014 and the indirect emissions (Scope 3) from the production of the \njet fuel we use and the consumption of jet fuel used by our contracted regional carriers.\nOur strategy is focused on driving progress across several key levers \u2014 some of which we \nhave the ability to influence directly, and some of which will require action, collaboration \nand innovation within our industry, across sectors and by policymakers.\nUnderpinning our strategy is our analysis of the climate-related risks and opportunities \nfacing our company. We initially conducted the analysis in 2020, and, in early 2023, we \nfurther expanded and deepened it by incorporating 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenarios, consistent \nwith the ambition of the Paris Agreement, in our assessment of both physical and \ntransition risks. This includes the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by \n2050 Scenario, which we selected because it includes aviation-specific narratives and \nmilestones.

The SAF available \non the market today can reduce life cycle GHG emissions by up to 85% compared with \nconventional, petroleum-based jet fuel, and new technologies and pathways hold the \npromise of delivering SAF with closer to 100% life cycle emission reductions. The reality, \nhowever, is that as critical as SAF is for achieving our own and the industry\u2019s climate \ngoals, it is not yet available at the scale or price needed to be a feasible alternative for \nwidespread commercial use \u2014 and achieving that will require the combined efforts of \nthe private and public sectors. \nHow American is helping accelerate solutions\nPurchasing and helping scale SAF production is a core part of American\u2019s climate \nstrategy this decade. For example, we anticipate SAF will be key to achieving the in-\nsector reductions required to meet our science-based target for 2035, and we have set \na goal to replace 10% of our jet fuel use with SAF in 2030.

The energy sector needs \nto align its capital commitments, while the financial sector must find more effective ways to \nsupport the SAF market. Standard setters need to recognize new solutions, and policymakers \nneed to enact smart policies that will drive further investment in the industry. \nThe past year has seen some progress, including the creation of U.S. Airline Principles on \nUse of Book and Claim in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Accounting, which provides a robust \nmarket mechanism for efficiently connecting SAF buyers and producers.

FT can also use \nCO2 captured from industrial emissions \u2014 and one day CO2 removed \nfrom the atmosphere \u2014 but that process is still very expensive. \nWhile FT is a proven technology in other applications, successfully \ncommercializing it for aviation has been difficult.\nAdvancing Next-Generation  \nSAF Pathways\nAchieving the decarbonization potential of \nSAF will be a journey, with the feedstocks \nthat are available today being replaced over \ntime with more efficient ones that provide \ngreater reductions in life cycle emissions. \n1 https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/sustainable-aviation-fuel\n18\nAmerican Airlines \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4339, "end_char_idx": 6746, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6280ad37-177c-48cb-a4fb-b85d57ae6bb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6280ad37-177c-48cb-a4fb-b85d57ae6bb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02e923a6-92b6-483c-b7e7-94b58f3f85d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "efa41e1c257293ebb7cfd9b9823f29f94f2a1a968204d216be9c2cc571473f60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Raising the Bar on SAF\nInfinium is a U.S.-based provider of electrofuels \u2014 also known as eFuels.

The green \nhydrogen is produced through electrolysis \u2014 powered by locally generated renewable \nenergy \u2014 and stored at or near airports. The only emission in flight is water vapor. \nZeroAvia is working to retrofit and linefit its powertrains to existing Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA)-certified fixed-wing aircraft, which simplifies regulatory issues \nand reduces time to market. In early 2023, ZeroAvia flew the maiden flight of its 19-\nseat Dornier 228 testbed aircraft, retrofitted with a full-size prototype hydrogen-electric \npowertrain on the left wing of the aircraft. Since then, it has completed 13 test flights \nand has an active certification application with the FAA for this powertrain in an aircraft \nwith up to 20 seats.\nZeroAvia\u2019s second engine class, which will ultimately power regional jets, is in active \ndevelopment, with ground testing of electric propulsion systems and advanced fuel cell \ntechnologies underway. Ultimately, the company hopes to scale the technology over the \nnext decade to narrowbody aircraft. \nIn July 2024, American announced its conditional purchase agreement for 100 hydrogen-\nelectric engines, intended to power regional jet aircraft, from ZeroAvia\u2019s powertrain \ndevelopment program.\nAdvancing Other Critical Next-Gen Aircraft Technologies\nWhile hydrogen offers significant potential for decarbonizing aviation over the \nlong term, achieving net zero by 2050 will depend on the development of other \nnearer-term and more scalable solutions.\nAmerican is collaborating with Boeing and NASA as a member of a coalition that \nis advising the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project and the development of \nthe X-66A research aircraft. The X-plane is a full-scale demonstrator aircraft with \nextra-long, thin wings stabilized by diagonal struts, known as a Transonic Truss-\nBraced Wing concept. When combined with other advancements in propulsion \nsystems, materials and systems architecture, the new design could result in \nup to 30% less fuel consumption and reduced emissions when compared with \ntoday\u2019s best-in-class aircraft.3\nIn addition, American has invested in Vertical Aerospace Ltd., which is \ndeveloping an emissions-free electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) \naircraft. In 2023, Vertical made significant progress advancing its work, being \none of a few eVTOL developers to have built and flown a full-scale, vectored-\nthrust electric aircraft. Vertical also opened a state-of-the-art battery facility, \nwhich is developing next-generation battery technology for aviation. \nVertical is the only developer to have active certification efforts with five \nregulators across the world and last year secured the first ever Design \nOrganisation Approval issued to a listed eVTOL manufacturer from the U.K. Civil \nAviation Authority. This is a prerequisite for the VX4 aircraft certification, which \nVertical is targeting to receive by the end of 2026. \nThis year Vertical is finalizing the assembly of its more advanced VX4 prototype, \nwhich will undergo a robust flight test program.\n3 See https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/next-generation-experimental-aircraft-becomes-nasas-  \nnewest-x-plane/ for more information.\n21\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3917, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76075038-6705-4026-a6c6-2c34186bebf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "76075038-6705-4026-a6c6-2c34186bebf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1daf8dd-d27c-4262-9d0d-80bb591920c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "4d76e0417a2491b5b22d6404502d1007f7f8725a14708cadb3d6ef230ae8a43c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ACCELERATING DECARBONIZATION SOLUTIONS\nThe Challenges\nContrail  \nAvoidance\nReducing aviation\u2019s contribution to climate change requires understanding all our \nindustry\u2019s impacts and identifying ways to address them.

Below, he answers our questions on the \nscience behind contrail avoidance strategies, as well as some of the challenges in their \nimplementation. \nPrior to joining Breakthrough Energy, Marc worked as an applied scientist and \nentrepreneur in a diverse set of research and development efforts across fluid mechanics, \ngeospatial analytics and mobile healthcare. In 2020, he started a company to develop \ngeospatial data systems for climate mitigation and adaptation before transitioning to his \ncurrent work. Marc earned a Master of Science degree in Fluids and Thermal Sciences \nfrom Brown University and a Bachelor of Engineering from Dartmouth College.\nMarc, how would you compare the warming impact of contrails versus CO2?\nIt\u2019s hard to compare them precisely, but CO2 is weakly warming over a long period of \ntime, while contrails are strongly warming over a short period. But not all contrails have \nthe same warming effect. Persistent contrails at night clearly impact the climate the most. \nBy being more precise in our interventions and focusing on those, we have the greatest \nopportunity to make a difference.\nHow can we predict where warming contrails will occur?\nThere are fundamentally two ways to go about this. One involves using physics and \nmeteorology to predict regions or volumes of air that should be avoided. The other uses \nobservational techniques on the ground and from satellites to see where aircraft are \nactually forming contrails. In our work towards solving this problem, we need both. \nWhat are the scientific challenges? \nThe type of atmospheric condition that creates persistent contrails is called ice \nsupersaturation, which is a fancy way of saying the temperature is really cold and the \nhumidity is high. Predicting that state is something that models have a hard time doing \ntoday. Another challenge is predicting these atmospheric states on as fine a scale as \nyou need. Weather forecasts generally correspond to a grid, say, 25 kilometers by 25 \nkilometers. In that grid, you might have multiple fluctuations of supersaturation states. So, \nthe model resolves to the average and it\u2019s wrong sometimes.\nIs there an easy way to describe your model?\nThink of it like a weather forecast. We predict the probability that a contrail will form and \nan estimate of that contrail\u2019s severity. The first part indicates how likely it is that an aircraft \nwill form a persistent contrail in a particular area. The second part tells us that if we found a \ncontrail in that area, it would likely have a particular persistence and impact on the climate.\nAvoiding a contrail might also result in greater CO2 emissions. How should we \nlook at the trade-off?\nThere is a cost in added fuel and CO2 that potentially gets added to the atmosphere as a \nresult of avoidance maneuvers. Our models are telling us, though, only a few flights will \nbe affected, and avoidance still results in a net climate benefit even over 100 years. We \ncould reduce these added emissions if airlines had access to SAF. But from an operating \nstandpoint, there\u2019s a cost to the airline business in terms of greater fuel use, and no \nmechanism exists to share that cost right now.\nHow do you see American\u2019s role in helping advance the solution?\nThe airlines are essentially on the front line of solving this problem because you are the \nones that would implement the solution. So, what American is doing in helping us run \ntrials is truly critical to advancing the research. The biggest hurdle to get through right \nnow is not model development. It\u2019s having the chance to really test and validate the \nmodel. Additionally, having a major airline working on this issue is a valuable signal  \nthat it\u2019s important.\n24\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4380, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6339d58-0233-4cbe-baa9-82992face9d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6339d58-0233-4cbe-baa9-82992face9d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e43cb825-1919-4461-9e3d-162435c467d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "e656db00cd81a42e6151f7417a148ab9270195d9903a4725ba885bdd7e06ce94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ACCELERATING DECARBONIZATION SOLUTIONS\nVoluntary  \nCarbon Markets\nAviation is regarded as one of the sectors that is hardest to abate in terms of climate \nimpact.

The largest airline catering kitchen in the country, it participates \nin a program that turns food waste into compost. As trays and dishes are cleaned, \nthis waste is collected by a vendor and distributed to farms and compost facilities. \nPreconsumer composting from this facility and our Admirals Club locations at DFW \nyielded more than 419,000 pounds in 2023. \nIn late 2023, we began a trial with one of our caterers to measure food waste from  \nmeals served on flights from London Heathrow Airport to DFW. This project takes \npictures of trays after flights and uses AI to analyze the food that is left behind. This \nhelps us determine passenger preferences for certain dishes, adjust our offerings \naccordingly and reduce waste. Rightsizing the food we have on board will help us lower \ncosts, while the weight savings can help us cut down on fuel use and  \nthe associated emissions.\nLeveraging recycled plastic and other alternatives in our cabin offerings \nand cargo operations\nAmerican has long recycled cans, paper, bottles and other trash removed from our \naircraft. We have also been exploring ways to reduce or eliminate single-use plastics on \nboard our aircraft, including the possibility of using recycled plastic alternatives.\nFor the relaunch of our soft goods program in April 2024, American collaborated with the \ninflight textile company John Horsfall to develop bedding made with recycled materials \nfrom its Re-Thread\u00ae collection. Nearly all the pillows, duvets and blankets created for \nAmerican flights are made with recycled fibers that maintain a premium feel, while filled \nbedding includes 100% recycled fill.\nTo reduce single-use plastic waste connected to the distribution of pillows and blankets, \ncustomers traveling in Flagship\u00ae First, Flagship\u00ae Business and Premium Economy will now \nreceive their bedding in a reusable zipper bag also made with recycled fibers. Using the \nbag is expected to eliminate 25 tons of plastic waste per year.\nIn our Cargo operations, we expanded our transition to the BioNatur Plastics\u2122 that we \nbegan using in 2022 to replace traditional plastic stretch wrap and pallet covers. This \nproduct line fully biodegrades in eight to 12 years under landfill conditions \u2014 compared \nwith the more than 500 years it can take for normal plastics \u2014 and it is designed to be \nfully recyclable in normal waste collection streams.\nIn 2023, we extended the use of BioNatur Plastics beyond our U.S. hubs to include \nregional domestic stations, such as Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Honolulu International \nAirport and Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. We \nalso began using the product line at select locations outside the \nUnited States, including Carrasco International \nAirport in Uruguay and Santiago \nInternational Airport in Chile. As \na result, this helped American \nreduce long-term plastic  \nwaste in landfills by over \n150,000 pounds for the year \n(equivalent to approximately \n8.6 million plastic bottles).  \nThat represents a more than \n15% improvement compared \nwith 2022.\nReducing aircraft noise\nAmerican is committed to addressing the concerns that local communities raise \naround aircraft noise. For example, we participate in several airport community \nroundtables on this topic, and we received a 2022 gold award from the Los \nAngeles International Airport Fly Quieter Program. We have also voluntarily \nretrofitted all pre-2014 Airbus A320 jets in our fleet with fuel vent  \nvortex generators, which help reduce aircraft noise.\nAmerican continues to meet or exceed International Civil Aviation Organization \n(ICAO) noise certification standards as well. ICAO standards currently specify \nthat operators can fly Stage 3, Stage 4 or Stage 5 aircraft. All our mainline and \nregional fleet meet Stage 4 noise certification levels, and 20% meet Stage 5 \nnoise certification levels.\n28\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4301, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00af2cb7-0e0a-40f6-8a0a-14dce259c0e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "00af2cb7-0e0a-40f6-8a0a-14dce259c0e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4aad9ace-c8a0-4c58-8196-af503a99ac87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "098c1fee2516ca5173ce776efbec31f61e7499886b556ca4511316bebb460bda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Expanding Our Commitment to Prevent Illegal Trafficking of Wildlife\nIn 2022, American became the first U.S. airline to join the Transport \nTaskforce of United for Wildlife, and, in 2023, we continued to implement \nour commitments outlined in the Buckingham Palace Declaration. \nThis organization, established by the Royal Foundation of the Prince and \nPrincess of Wales, is working to protect elephants, rhinos, monkeys, birds, \ninsects, reptiles and other endangered species, including plants, from the \nillegal wildlife trade that is pushing them toward extinction.

We \nalso saw injury rates rise year over year, mainly related to improper lifting. To mitigate \nthese injuries, we continued expanding a training program that focuses on proper manual \nhandling techniques. More than 10,000 team members \u2014 roughly half of our mainline fleet \nservice personnel \u2014 have completed it, and we plan to expand the program over the next \nyear. A team member returning from an injury will also receive refresher training on safe \nlifting practices, and we conduct campaigns to remind colleagues of proper techniques on \nan ongoing basis. In the second half of 2023, we saw lifting injuries begin to decline.\nWe were heartbroken to have experienced two team member fatalities in 2023. The first \noccurred in April, when a team member driving a ground service vehicle struck a jet bridge \nat Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas. American coordinated closely with \nOSHA as it completed its investigation, and though we were not cited in this accident \nor found to have violated any OSHA standards, we constantly seek ways that we can \nstrengthen and enhance our safety practices. The second fatality occurred in September, \nwhen a team member was injured in a ground accident at Wilmington International Airport \nin North Carolina. We will cooperate closely with OSHA as it investigates. We want every \none of our team members to go home safely at the end of each day and will continue to \nwork to provide the safest environment for our team members and customers.\nSafety reporting\nThe overall goal of team member reporting is to improve safety awareness and identify \noperational deficiencies by facilitating an open line of communication between team \nmembers and management without fear of reprisal. Potential safety concerns and \nsuggestions identified through our many safety reporting programs are critical to early \nidentification and mitigation of hazards. These reports also allow the company to proactively \naddress potential risks and implement corrective actions to resolve safety and security issues.\nWhen team members identify any safety-related concern, they are encouraged to report the \nissue. Once the concern is received, skilled safety investigators collaborate with operational \npartners to review the information provided, assess the hazard and develop corrective \nactions to address the issue. Operational and safety leaders review these reports as part \nof the broader SMS to determine if there are system-related risks developing. We follow up \nwith the reporter to communicate what we learned and what steps we are taking to prevent \nsimilar concerns from arising again. This follow-through and prompt action helps encourage \nadditional reporting, thus creating a robust safety reporting life cycle.\nOur most prominent safety reporting initiatives include the following: Aviation Safety \nAction Programs, Ground Safety Action Programs, Flight Operations Quality Assurance, \nthe International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit, Line Operations \nSafety Audits and the Learning and Improvement Team.\nSafety Action Programs\nEveryone at American has a role to play in ensuring that our people, customers and assets \nremain safe. Through Aviation Safety Action Programs (ASAPs), we encourage team members \nto confidentially report potential hazards and errors without concern of fault or fear of punitive \naction, thus reinforcing a learning culture and improving our operations along the way. \nAmerican was the first airline to create an ASAP, and now such programs are commonplace \namong airlines worldwide. Currently, we have ASAPs for our Flight, Flight Service, Dispatch, \nRecognizing Team Member Contributions to Safety\nTo showcase the great work our team members do to enhance safety, we \nlaunched a Safety Champion program in 2023 that honored 24 individuals. \nNominees were selected by other team members based on their efforts \nto enhance our safety culture, advocate when they have concerns and \nproactively seek solutions to safety issues. A diverse panel representing \nworkgroups across the company selected the winners, each of whom \nreceived a prize equivalent to $1,000 and was recognized at an event with \nsenior leaders. For 2024, up to 40 team members will be selected.\n33\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4719, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bea0b884-71a4-4449-a8a3-fd46655d19b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "bea0b884-71a4-4449-a8a3-fd46655d19b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "982b614c-62b4-4d82-960c-4abac32e7c89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "30fe343cdd846a0dcc47e1ee3c1c49629dee8b2b7574c86176347c08604aa969", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Technical Operations, Central Load Planning and Ground (Fleet Service and Cargo) teams, \nwhich we believe gives us significantly greater coverage than the industry average. \nIn 2023, we recorded 15,374 ASAP reports, a 25% increase over 2022. This increase is \na welcome trend, providing evidence that our team members are comfortable raising \nconcerns. This provides us with more opportunities to review and resolve them. In \naddition, these reports are used to analyze trends and proactively identify potential \nsafety hazards.\nFlight Operations Quality Assurance\nFlight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) is a voluntary safety program administered \njointly by American and the Allied Pilots Association (APA) that uses routinely recorded \nflight data to proactively identify and correct deficiencies in flight operations. We routinely \nmonitor all our flights and use algorithms to look for potential safety risks and trends. The \nresults allow us to monitor aircraft systems, performance and operational efficiency and \nhelp us to better understand pilot performance in the operating environment.\nTo enhance FOQA\u2019s effectiveness, American has partnered with Collins Aerospace to \nretrofit our narrowbody aircraft with a wireless data transfer system that improves the \nspeed with which we can retrieve FOQA data. This initiative helps us increase accuracy \nin monthly reporting, improve aircraft reliability and prepare for future products and \ncapabilities. At the end of 2023, 81% of our fleet was equipped with this tool, and we \nexpect that American\u2019s entire fleet will be outfitted by the end of 2026. \nIn 2022, American became the first carrier in the United States to adopt CEFA Aviation \nMobile Services, a cloud-based application that allows pilots to recreate their flights on \ntheir company tablet. This tool improves on the concept of crew postflight debriefing by \nproviding real-time feedback to our pilots, turning each flight into a learning opportunity \nand ultimately contributing to the Safety Assurance of our SMS. In March 2024, we \nexpanded the use of this application to make it available to all pilots across our mainline \nfleet.\nInternational Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit \nAs part of our commitment to transparency and monitoring, we are a registered \nparticipant in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Operational Safety Audit \n(IOSA) program, an internationally recognized evaluation system designed to assess \nan airline\u2019s operational management and control systems. An IOSA, which takes place \nevery two years, creates a structured methodology with standardized checklists that are \ncomparable on a worldwide basis, enabling and maximizing the joint use of audit reports. \nIn April 2023, we successfully completed our IOSA in conformance with all standards and \nrecommended practices. IATA modified its audit methodology in 2023 to be risk based. \nAs part of our efforts to be an industry leader, American volunteered to be the first U.S. \ncarrier to participate under this new approach.\nLine Operations Safety Audits\nSince launching our continuous Line Operations Safety Audits (LOSA) program for pilots \nin 2017, we have been sending highly trained pilot observers onto the flight deck to better \nunderstand work-as-done versus work-as-imagined. Observing our frontline team members \nin action and gathering safety-related data on environmental conditions, operational \ncomplexities and crew performance in real time provides us with valuable insights for \nenhancing safety and resilience. In 2023, our pilot LOSA observers conducted 568 flight \ndeck observations that resulted in improvements in our flight manuals and training.\n34\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3983, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c38d1fd-d98a-41c3-bbc6-b3555f2f5e94": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c38d1fd-d98a-41c3-bbc6-b3555f2f5e94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66a07d55-0df8-469d-b21a-4dc9e1d52566", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "385e91cb43ac5bb25c3eef39f48fe1d8f611ddc718a6bd9019477189c3dec1f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2afc6a1-dc3c-49a6-977b-75f5b17ac47e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a78106e0bdb8baa1551da114bf57f86e558ae77f0387b37516c0f4096edbba8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "American has expanded LOSA to other workgroups as well. Using the continuous \nDispatch LOSA launched in late 2021, we were able to conduct 180 observations in 2023. \nAmerican is also the only U.S. carrier to operate a continuous Cabin LOSA program, \nwhich we launched in October 2023. This program is helping us better understand the \nchallenges facing our flight attendants and the measures we can take to keep the cabin \nsafe for everyone. We will continue to evaluate the feasibility of bringing LOSA to other \noperational groups.\nLearning and Improvement Team\nWe created the Learning and Improvement Team (LIT) in 2022 to collect and analyze \ndata on what makes our pilots successful in their everyday work. The goal of LIT is to \nidentify specific behaviors that go above and beyond standard operating procedures \nand to share these and other positive observations in recurrent training and new-\ncaptain classes. \nWhile similar in some ways to LOSA, LIT is unique. It is a Safety-II initiative that has \nemerged across multiple industries and focuses on what goes well and why. Doing so \nprovides a new safety lens through which to view the operation. Combining LIT data \nwith other SMS data provides American with a broader picture of the system, rather than \nlooking solely at unwanted outcomes. \nProtecting team members from extreme heat\nSeveral of our hubs, such as Phoenix and Dallas, are in locations where temperatures \ncan exceed 100\u00b0F during the summer months. That can put team members working on \nthe ramp or in other roles with prolonged exposure at risk of dehydration or heatstroke. \nAmong our current safeguards, we reinforce the message that team members should \nnotify their manager if they need a break. American also maintains hydration carts \nthat circle the ramp during daylight hours as well as fixed hydration stations to support \nteam members working outside. We operate multiple temporary cool zones as well \n\u2014 consisting of a shaded area and water station \u2014 on the ramp when temperatures \nare high. We also encourage team members to take breaks indoors. Seasonal safety \ncommunication initiatives aim to make team members more aware of seasonal risks and \nprovide tips on how they can best protect themselves. \nExploring new technologies to enhance safety \nAmerican continues to leverage technology to improve our safety processes. For example, \nour narrowbody fleet has completed the transition from paper aircraft maintenance \nlogbooks to an Electronic Aircraft Maintenance Log (eAML) system. Among its benefits, \neAML allows the Technical Operations team members the ground to use their tablets to \naccess an aircraft\u2019s maintenance log before it even reaches the gate. That helps us get \naircraft back into the air as quickly as possible. \nAmerican is also exploring the use of computer vision, a field of artificial intelligence, \nto improve safety and efficiency during gate turn operations. The arrival and departure \nof every flight is a process that involves the convergence of aircraft, pilots, fleet service \nteam members, aviation maintenance technicians and multiple vendors. Computer vision \ninvolves the installation of video cameras at key locations at the gate and jet bridge to \ncapture the movements of everyone involved in deplaning and getting an aircraft ready to \ntake off again. Using machine learning, the system can gather valuable data and insights \nfrom the captured footage to improve workflow and develop strategies for preventing \ninjuries. We recently completed a pilot project that focused on four gates at Dallas Fort \nWorth International Airport, and the early results have shown promise.\nProviding Peer Support for Pilots\nPilots face great responsibilities every time they enter the flight deck, and we \ncontinually look for ways to provide them with whatever support they require. \nAmong our longstanding initiatives, Project Wingman offers pilots a safe and \nconfidential place to talk about whatever they may be facing without the pressure \nto mask or hide sensitive details. American created this program in 2011 through a \njoint effort with the APA Aeromedical Committee.\nProject Wingman\u2019s success is predicated on pilots providing support on a volunteer \nbasis to their fellow aviators in the American pilot community. Nearly 50 American \npilots currently participate. In addition to bringing a unique understanding of \nthe challenges their colleagues can face in their professional and personal lives, \nthese volunteers undergo specialized, intensive training. As a result, they are well-\npositioned to know when to listen and provide encouragement or recommend \nother resources if a situation warrants greater intervention.\nAwareness of and access to Project Wingman are embedded throughout pilots\u2019 \njourneys at American.

SRM enables us to consider the risks \nin our operations and reduce them to an acceptable level. We use the SRM process \nwhenever there is a significant change to our operations, such as delivery of a new \ntype of aircraft or the addition of a new airport to our network. We also apply SRM \nwhen our Safety Assurance process identifies a new hazard or ineffective control of an \nexisting hazard.\nWe use several tools to identify hazards and evaluate the need for new or revised risk \ncontrols. The process of risk management is the same regardless of the trigger or event, \nand our SMS looks at multiple factors for risk. While the FAA requirements are geared \ntoward flight safety, our SMS goes further to evaluate a wider range of global risks, \nincluding operational disruptions. \nSafety Promotion\nSafety culture is the foundation of any SMS, with trust at the core. At American, we \nbelieve in a Just Culture approach, which encourages each team member to take \nresponsibility and assume accountability for achieving the highest safety standards and \nresults. This approach, which we have championed for more than a decade and which \nhas since become an accepted aviation industry standard, encourages team members to \nreport errors, risky decisions or omissions without fear of punitive actions.\nStaySafe and safety engagement\nStaySafe is a safety communications campaign implemented across our Airport and \nTechnical Operations teams. It focuses on lessons learned and ways to prevent team \nmember injuries and equipment damage. Bulletins and alerts are available across multiple \nplatforms in order to reach the greatest number of team members affected.\nOur safety engagement efforts bring company leadership to the front lines to engage in \nconversations with team members. Managers can communicate safety expectations, assess \nrisks in the operation and reinforce safe behaviors. Our airport and technical operations \nteams use a safety engagement application so that any engagements with team members \nare logged in the system so that we can learn from trends and share best practices.\nFor detailed safety performance data, see page 75. \n36\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4191, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1acfb6d9-8bea-45a2-bf82-8321d7e9d530": {"__data__": {"id_": "1acfb6d9-8bea-45a2-bf82-8321d7e9d530", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3ac73a7-7865-4a76-9de9-5adef064cb30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "88724cd5d2bfd74edf16e07a2cccb3c7dee17d9ec90ceeb23047c4d30a862de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "American is focused \non attracting the best \nand brightest talent \nand investing in their \ndevelopment.\nSUPPORTING OUR \nTEAM MEMBERS", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 132, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa9e280d-4c69-4ede-8cce-5b76966629ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa9e280d-4c69-4ede-8cce-5b76966629ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66ba7f34-8517-4ca2-909a-1e2cd53329d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "e635bd0ba7607b829afbf7953c89311c39c32cafaaaf71e1b070e0809d9196b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "American is a people business, working to deliver, \nconnect and care for people on life\u2019s journey. The \ntalent and dedication of our more than 140,000 \nteam members are the most important drivers  \nof our success.\nOur culture is American\u2019s competitive advantage, and it is centered on attracting the \nbest and brightest talent and investing in their development and well-being. American is \nalso dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment where people from all backgrounds \nfeel welcome and valued. We believe this is critical to our success both today and in the \nfuture. We have accomplished much and continue to identify opportunities for further \nenhancing the team member experience.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nOur strength lies in having a team that effectively serves the communities we represent. \nWe are proud to be a place where people of diverse generations, races, ethnicities, \ngenders, sexual orientations, abilities, religions and other backgrounds are genuinely \nincluded and valued, strengthening our ability to better serve and connect with our \ncustomer base and the communities in which we operate. \nLeading the charge on inclusion\nAmerican is committed to advancing inclusion at all levels. We\u2019re doing this by holding \nleaders more accountable for creating a workplace that is truly welcoming. Through \nongoing training and open dialogue, we\u2019re equipping our leaders with the skills they need \nto champion inclusion. This includes building their cultural competence, which allows \nthem to understand, value and collaborate effectively with people from all backgrounds. \nThat is why our 2023 incentive compensation plan for company leaders included diversity, \nequity and inclusion (DEI) engagement and education goals. For 2023, these goals were \nincluded in the compensation plan. For engagement, the goal was for 93% of leaders \nat the manager level or above to participate in at least two DEI-related engagement \nactivities or events. (For managing directors and above, the goal was to participate in a \nleadership capacity.) For education, the goal was for 93% of the company to complete \nDEI training. We surpassed both thresholds, with 99% of leaders participating in or \nleading two or more events to develop cultural competence and 98% of team members \ncompleting \u201cThe Power of Inclusion \u2014 Winning Together\u201d training. \nEducation for all team members is an important part of our journey to realizing the full \npower of inclusion \u2014 from implicit bias training to our web-based inclusion education \nseries that equips team members with the skills to speak up on behalf of others. Many of \nour other development programs, such as the Women\u2019s Leadership Program, help recruit \nand retain leaders throughout our company.\nAmerican recognizes that every leader shares a responsibility for hiring and developing \nthe best talent while also championing diversity. To select the top candidates and include \nall perspectives in the process, we seek to interview a diverse slate of qualified individuals \nfor all management-level positions. We also strive to have diverse interview panels for all \nleadership positions so that we can select the most qualified candidates.\n38\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3480, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad0ddc56-70f3-492a-b520-4b773646312a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad0ddc56-70f3-492a-b520-4b773646312a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ae9727f-85d0-4ef0-88b9-d0523244faf7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "473724c8ab029b0a29a80ae4415749cfe35431e25041bebee480be4d4f113b92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76463939-5f3e-491e-917b-6264e7df1220", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd1db790a91bcad6f995fda1a3c0584b59593f2aa085e23a801c7b785594f04c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Connecting team members  \nthrough our Employee Business \nResource Groups\nCreating a more inclusive environment \nby engaging team members is a top \npriority.

Additionally, our DEI efforts have received the highest scores on the \nSeramount Inclusion Index, and we were honored to have the Dallas Business Journal \nrecognize American\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer with a 2023 Leader in Diversity award.\nPromoting fairness through a commitment to pay equity\nAmerican has long championed pay equity, and we are committed to pay parity for the \nsame job regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. Our team members covered by collective \nbargaining agreements have built-in pay equity as part of those agreements. Therefore, \nwe have focused our pay equity efforts on the remaining portion of our workforce \u2014 made \nup of management and support staff \u2014 who do not belong to unions.\nAmerican uses Syndio\u2019s workplace equity platform, which helps us analyze and address \npay gaps in our workforce. Our approach begins by placing each team member in one \nof approximately 50 \u201csimilarly situated groups\u201d (SSGs) across American based on the \ntype of work they do. We then identify factors that can drive compensation variation \nwithin each SSG, such as an individual\u2019s specific pay scale, seniority or experience.\nIn 2021, American became the first airline to receive Fair Pay Workplace\u2019s \ninaugural pay equity certification, which is based on a company\u2019s \nidentification and remediation of pay equity issues. This Seattle-based \norganization is working to dismantle pay disparities based on gender, \nrace and ethnicity to create sustained fair pay. It is backed by an \nindependent alliance of equity experts from academia, business and \ntechnology. American was recertified in both 2022 and 2023, and we \nremain one of only a handful of large U.S. companies in any industry to be \ncertified. The Rules and Standards for Certification are available to the public.\nAmong the certification requirements, American regularly undergoes a seven-point \nreview of our remediation plan by Fair Pay Workplace. We have also pledged not to ask \njob candidates about their prior compensation or expectations for starting pay, which Fair \nPay Workplace has identified as among the largest sources of pay gaps.\nRecruitment\nRecruiting the best talent for all roles across American is critical to our ongoing success. \nTwo areas of particular focus are pilots and aviation maintenance professionals. We have \nmade significant progress, but replenishing their ranks requires a long-term outlook.\nIdentifying Pay Gaps\nThe chart below shows American\u2019s controlled pay gap for gender and race/\nethnicity as of February 2024. By running a pay analysis on a regular basis,  \nwe quickly close any gaps.\nPeople of color (POC) earned $1 \nfor every $1 earned by white team \nmembers in similar jobs.\nPOC\n$1 $1\nWhite\n99\u00a2 $1\nFemale Male\nWomen earned 99\u20b5 for every $1 \nearned by men in similar jobs.\nDeveloping a pipeline for pilots and aviation maintenance professionals\nAmerican hired more than 2,000 pilots in 2023 and expects to add a substantial number \nin 2024. To sustain a strong pipeline of qualified candidates, we have been working to \ncreate awareness of, access to, and opportunities for careers in aviation for those who \notherwise might not know it is possible. The American Airlines Cadet Academy helps us \nachieve our recruitment goals. Cadets from multiple ethnic, geographic and economic \nbackgrounds come together at the Cadet Academy, which strives to address financial \nobstacles by providing flight training students with affordable financing opportunities and \na predictable path to completion. \nCadet Academy students are expected to take approximately three years to complete \nthe program and become airline-ready professional pilots. They are then guaranteed \nplacement at one of American\u2019s regional carriers: Envoy Air, PSA Airlines or Piedmont \nAirlines. Accumulation of flight hours leads in due course to a conditional job offer with \nthat regional carrier. Over 950 cadets have entered the Cadet Academy since its launch \nin 2018, and more than 110 now fly for one of our regional carriers. Since American has \ncontractual flow-through agreements with each of our regional carriers, pilots who are \nhired by one of them have the opportunity to be hired by American as a mainline pilot.\n40\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4512, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e04d46d-3bf8-4a7c-b313-7ee4acbb39be": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e04d46d-3bf8-4a7c-b313-7ee4acbb39be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92078430-ab8d-45f8-8277-384d445f6a35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "ebfab86f2449d3088cb127b2288da80f0e0d77657f29a825793ecddbb2436955", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In 2023, the Cadet Academy expanded its training footprint by adding Luke Weathers Jr. \nFlight Academy in Olive Branch, Mississippi, which is run by the Organization of Black \nAerospace Professionals (OBAP), as well as Infinity Flight Group in Trenton, New Jersey. \nThis brings the total number of program locations to seven, including CAE in Phoenix, \nCoast Flight Training in San Diego, Dallas and San Marcos, Texas, as well as Spartan \nCollege of Aeronautics and Technology in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Currently, she is responsible for the Flight Operations Manual, \nbetter known as the rulebook for pilots, in her role as American\u2019s Director \nof Flight Operations Training Policies and Procedures.\nAs she traversed her path from aspiring lawyer to Airbus A321 captain, Hecker \nembraced opportunities to mentor other pilots, both at American and in her \nmore than two decades of volunteer work as a member of Women in Aviation \nInternational (WAI). In 2024, she is stepping down from WAI\u2019s board of directors. \nShe has held this post since 2017, the last two years as its chair.\n\u201cWAI is one of the many great organizations that are trying to move the dial \nto get more women into aviation careers, \u201d says Captain Hecker, who was \nhired by American after receiving a WAI scholarship. \u201cIt encourages women \nto look at a variety of career options, not just flying. That could include \nmaintenance, dispatch, engineering and aircraft design, to name just a few \nareas. Many are jobs that don\u2019t necessarily require a \nfour-year degree. \u201d\nCaptain Hecker herself has played a variety \nof roles at American, including working on \nthe pilot recruitment team and as a Customer \nExperience project manager.

Since its \ninception, this scholarship has provided \napproximately $150,000 to help fund \nflight training for women.\nInspiring the Next Generation of Aviation Professionals\nAt American, we believe it\u2019s never too early to begin laying the foundation for a \ncareer in aviation. That led us to team up with the nonprofit CR Smith Museum \nand launch the Aviation Career Pathways program in October 2023. This multiyear \ninitiative is providing seventh to 12th grade students in the Dallas Independent \nSchool District with access to aviation science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics (STEM) education along with a better understanding of aviation \nindustry career opportunities.\nIncreasing exposure to aviation STEM careers and skills comes with challenges, \nespecially when working with underserved communities. Most of the students \nparticipating in Aviation Career Pathways attend Title 1 schools, which include \na significant percentage of students from low-income families. The CR Smith \nMuseum, located on American\u2019s campus in Fort Worth, has studied these \nchallenges extensively and prioritized solutions in its education program. Among \nthem, students should benefit from the program\u2019s combination of touch points. \nAviation Career Pathway includes in-classroom programming, participation \nin the museum\u2019s annual Aviation Career Day, behind-the-scenes access to \nAmerican\u2019s operations and the opportunity to interact with team members.\nBeginning with the 2024\u201325 school year, this program will expand to include the \nFort Worth Independent School District as well.\nAnother part of our strategy includes regular participation in recruiting events. They \nare sponsored by industry organizations such as the Society of Hispanic Professional \nEngineers, National Society of Black Engineers , Sisters of the Skies , (WAI), NGPA, \nLatino Pilots Association, Professional Asian Pilots Association and OBAP.

As of \nJanuary 2024, team members can view all health spending, dependent care, commuter \nand retirement accounts with Fidelity in one place, through a single login. This creates \na more consolidated and simplified experience for our team members to manage their \nhealthcare and retirement assets.\n\u2022 Family support resources.

Through our partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, American \nalso helped expand the use of additional airspace routes to relieve congestion during \ndays with high traffic volume.\nWe have also invested in the infrastructure of our largest hub, Dallas Fort Worth \nInternational Airport (DFW), to support a busier schedule. In 2023, we opened our new \nDFW catering kitchen, a state-of-the-art facility to help address our growing catering \nneeds. (Read more about this facility on page 28.) We followed that with a new DFW  \nCentral Fulfillment Facility for aircraft parts, relocating a significant portion of our \ninventory from Tulsa.\n47\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3629, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9ae299e-9707-4c2c-82e6-e7fa96e863b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9ae299e-9707-4c2c-82e6-e7fa96e863b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b4bfd93-42af-4c56-98f6-722b838464ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "2be2ca5c0089b2b727520a84d492eaa6c3c6ec2ad7226e957d3fe872ff04f4b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Executing.  This comprises our focus on investing in people, processes and technology \nto deliver for our customers consistently. In 2023, we focused on improving the tools our \nteam can use to manage issues that might otherwise disrupt our operations. \nOur Smart Gating tool, for one, reduces situations where arriving aircraft must wait for \nan available gate. Developed in-house by American\u2019s Information Technology (IT) and \nOperations teams, Smart Gating uses real-time flight information and other data points \nto automatically assign arriving aircraft to the nearest available gate with the shortest \ntaxi time. That allows customers to spend less time waiting on the tarmac and have \nmore time to make their connections.\nInitially rolled out in 2022 at DFW, Smart Gating has helped shorten aircraft taxi times \nby an average of 20%. By the end of 2023, we had expanded this tool to our hubs at \nCharlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT), Miami International Airport (MIA), Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nAcross the system, Smart Gating has shortened taxi times by 17 hours per day. Moreover, \nit is designed to address each airport\u2019s unique needs. For example, at DCA, where ramp \nspace is limited, Smart Gating has reduced by 70% instances where an aircraft must wait \nat the gate due to another aircraft blocking the ramp. At CLT, it has decreased aircraft taxi \ntime by nearly a minute per flight and eliminated 11% of on-the-ground gate changes. \nSmart Gating yields important environmental benefits as well, and you can read about \nthem on page 13. \nAmerican has also made meaningful progress at improving our baggage handling, and \nin 2023 we reduced our mishandled baggage ratio by nearly 15%. One of the systemwide \nenhancements we made during the year included an initiative that helps us prioritize the \nbags of customers with tight connections. We now print a 1, 2 or 3 on bag tags based on \nconnection time. Bags with shorter connection times are loaded last onto aircraft at spoke \nairports so they can be unloaded first upon arrival at hubs and quickly transferred to \nconnecting flights.\nThese technological advancements were paired with advances in training, compliance \nand accountability across all internal and external partners in our operation. In 2023, \nin partnership with our frontline leaders, we rolled out individualized performance \ndashboards for some of our airport team members. Focusing on safety, compliance \nand performance, these dashboards give team members greater visibility into their \nperformance and opportunities to improve. The dashboards have been well received, and \nwe will explore expanding them to other workgroups. \nRecovering. This encompasses our work to recover from irregular operations more swiftly \nand efficiently than in the past. Although we can\u2019t control the weather, we can control \nour response. That means getting our crews, aircraft and customers back on track as \nquickly and safely as possible. We have invested more expertise, time and technology in \nirregular operations management and recovery, including development of a suite of tools \nto support our efforts. \nOur proprietary Hub Efficiency Analytics Tool (HEAT) is just one example. HEAT dynamically \nadjusts flight schedules to keep customers, crews and aircraft moving and to avoid \ncancellations when severe weather and other extraordinary situations threaten to disrupt our \nschedule. Using an advanced algorithm, HEAT weighs a variety of factors such as fullness \nAviation Week awarded American its prestigious \nLaureate Award for 2023\u201324 in recognition of our Hub \nEfficiency Analytics Tool (HEAT).

We deployed HEAT 28 times in 2023 \u2014 at CLT, DCA, DFW and MIA. Since its initial \ndeployment in 2022, we have used it to prevent nearly 1,000 flight cancellations. \nWe never want to cancel flights, but sometimes operating conditions make this inevitable. \nWhen this happens, we strive to accommodate customers in advance or as quickly as \npossible. In 2023, we rolled out a more effective reaccommodation tool that resulted in a \n19% improvement in the volume of customers who fly the rebooked solution and a 21% \nreduction in delay-to-destination hours.\nModernizing the digital experience for customers\nWe continued our efforts to modernize the travel experience in 2023. Our research has \nshown that customers prefer to handle the easiest aspects of travel on their own, so we \nput more power in their hands by enhancing the user experience and travel management \noptions on both aa.com and the American Airlines mobile app. \nAt the start of 2023, our website and mobile app allowed customers to address some of \ntheir ticket-related needs, such as rescheduling a trip, viewing and applying a travel credit \nto a trip, or adding special service requests during travel. Over the course of the year, we \nmodernized our technology and expanded functionality, allowing for the majority of customer \ntravel needs to be completed on a digital channel. Among our enhancements, customers \nwho book travel with American through a travel partner or another third party can now, \nin most cases, use the app or aa.com to make changes. Customers also have more digital \ncontrol over their reaccommodation options if irregular operations impact their scheduled \nflight. We have made it easier for customers to notify us if they have special service needs \nas well, such as traveling with wheelchairs or pets or if they are booking a flight that involves \nan unaccompanied minor. These and other improvements helped make ours the most \ndownloaded airline app of 2023 and among the year\u2019s top 10 most downloaded travel apps. \nAnd we are working to further improve our website and mobile app in 2024.\nGreater online and app functionality also frees up team members in our customer call centers \nto work with customers who have complex travel issues that require personal assistance. \nWe continually work to improve these personal interactions, and we follow up with Voice \nof the Customer surveys by phone or written channels to elicit feedback on our success. \nFor example, approximately 94% of survey responses related to domestic and international \nreservations for 2023 indicated that our customers were completely satisfied with the service \nthey received. Our satisfaction scores from AAdvantage\u00ae members are even higher.\nProviding speedier airport kiosks and  \nstreamlining credit redemptions\nAmerican implemented other improvements during the year beyond our digital channels. \nFor example, we rolled out new software across all our airport kiosks to make them faster \nand easier to use and installed entirely new ones in our largest hubs. These updates help \nstreamline travel for our customers by leading to shorter lines before security.\nIn 2023, we also simplified the management and redemption of travel credits. That included \nstreamlining the types of credits available into trip credits, flight credits and travel vouchers, \nwith the goal of consolidating to one in the long term. We also made it possible for \ncustomers on domestic flights to store trip credits and flight credits in their mobile wallets \nrather than in emails or in the form of a paper voucher.\nDelivering our inflight entertainment faster and with  \nmore diverse offerings\nWe make many television series and movie offerings available at no \ncost on most of our flights, and our narrowbody aircraft offer our \nwireless inflight entertainment platform for personal devices. \nOur offerings include a wide range of content that appeals \nto diverse preferences. Most of our films include optional \nsubtitles and are dubbed in many languages. We offer 10 \nto 20 selections to celebrate heritage months throughout \nthe year, such as Black History Month, Women\u2019s History \nMonth and Pride Month.

In 2023, we looked to the guidance of the Community \nCouncil we formed in 2020 to provide objective and candid insights on company initiatives, \nparticularly those focused on improving the customer travel experience and meeting the \nneeds of underrepresented customer groups, and we continued to help team members \nbuild cultural competency to further support this work. \nOne example is our work partnering with local organizations and airport colleagues to \nmake the travel process less of a mystery for children on the autism spectrum. Through \nIt\u2019s Cool to Fly American (ICTFA), we offer these children and their families a mock travel \nexperience that replicates the hustle and bustle of air travel. In an experience that lasts \nabout three and a half hours, they park, check in, wait at the gate, board, taxi, return to \nthe gate and retrieve their luggage without actually taking off. Since its inception in 2014, \nICTFA has served more than 8,000 participants and 4,500 families.\nPosting record passenger satisfaction scores\nAmerican rigorously gathers customer satisfaction data through passenger surveys, using \nthe results to enhance our operations. Based on a sampling of approximately 3 million \ncustomer surveys, our Likelihood to Recommend (LTR) score rose to a company-best 76.6 \nfor 2023. Our fourth-quarter score of 79.7 was the highest of any quarter in our history. \nThese results reflect the significant investments that we\u2019ve made to improve both check-\nin and boarding as well as baggage handling, trip credit redemptions and the ability to \nmanage an upcoming travel reservation at aa.com or through our mobile app. In fact, \ncustomers who used our app at least once before or during their trip consistently rated \ntheir experience higher than did nonusers.\nLTR measures customer levels based on recent trips on a scale of 1 to 100 points, and our \nmethodology incorporates balanced feedback from both AAdvantage\u00ae loyalty program \nmembers and nonmembers. It has been a valuable tool in helping us set priorities. That \nsaid, we are always looking for ways to better identify areas where we excel or need \nimprovement. That includes tracking our Net Promoter Score (NPS), which helps measure \ncustomer brand loyalty and satisfaction using a scale of \u2013100 to +100. In contrast to LTR, \nwhich is based on an average of customer responses, NPS is calculated by subtracting the \npercentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.

In the event that we cannot seat an adult family \nmember and child together, we will rebook their flight at no extra cost or provide a refund \nif they choose not to travel.\nAmerican is also committed to accuracy in our communications and marketing. To help \ncustomers make informed decisions, we provide information about the benefits of flying \nwith American and strive to represent truthfully the social or environmental benefits of \nour activities.

In addition to traditional customer service \nchannels, we also offer convenient options that keep customers informed throughout their \ntravel journey, such as in-app chat functions, automated callback features and immediate \nautomated digital notifications.\nWhen it comes to navigating the most complex of customer concerns, American has a \nhighly trained, specialized team that works to handle these escalations promptly and \nappropriately. These team members work with stakeholders throughout the company to \nhandle all escalations and follow-up from across American\u2019s global operation. \nPrioritizing cybersecurity and data privacy\nCybersecurity and data privacy are key priorities at American. In February 2024, \nwe published our new SEC Form 10-K Item 1C disclosure related to cybersecurity \nrisk management, strategy and governance. In addition, in 2023, we updated our \nCybersecurity Policy Statement and Privacy Policy.\nAmerican has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program \nintended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and \ninformation. Our program is aligned with various National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) cybersecurity standards, guidelines and best practices.1 It includes \npolicies, standards and a variety of technical security solutions to prevent and respond to \ncybersecurity issues, and it is evaluated annually by a global cybersecurity firm.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for implementing our \ncybersecurity risk management program and reports to our Chief Digital and Information \nOfficer (CDIO). The CDIO, in turn, is a member of our Senior Leadership Team and reports \nto the CEO. \nOur cybersecurity risk management program is overseen by our Executive Cybersecurity \nRisk Group (ECRG), which comprises our CDIO, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal \nOfficer. Working with our CISO, the ECRG assists the Board of Directors and our Senior \nLeadership Team in fulfilling their responsibilities for cybersecurity governance. Our \nBoard oversees our work on cybersecurity, with the Audit Committee regularly reviewing \ncyber- and data privacy-risks and receiving briefings from senior leaders on these matters \nat least quarterly. The full Board also receives periodic briefings from management on our \ncyber-risk management program.\nAmerican also has a formal cybersecurity training and awareness program focused on \neducating our team members about cybersecurity risk and our internal policies and \nprocedures related to cybersecurity, privacy and compliance. Certain trainings, such \nas basic data security awareness, are conducted annually, and all team members and \ncontractors are expected to complete them.\n1 T his does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications or requirements, only that we \nuse various NIST security standards, guidelines and best practices to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity \nrisks relevant to our business.\n51\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4915, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32f3050f-b633-4635-9dfd-74766b689d98": {"__data__": {"id_": "32f3050f-b633-4635-9dfd-74766b689d98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b57da37-faa2-4e63-a49c-accdda30c252", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "bfaa19d0aaaebe8d4174b49075172c35e001920a78773543def0574ca3666b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A number of team members undergo additional cybersecurity and data privacy training \ndepending on their roles and responsibilities.

Some minor issues can be corrected by alerting the \nsupplier to the problem. For more serious issues, such as those potentially impacting \nsafety or security, we require suppliers to submit a corrective action plan that we can \nmonitor for implementation. If the supplier cannot identify a suitable solution, we work \ndirectly with the supplier to improve its performance. We will terminate a business \nrelationship if our efforts prove unsuccessful.\nLooking ahead, we intend to expand our responsible sourcing efforts and disclosures on \nour progress.

To \ninform our understanding of the climate risk landscape, we conducted an initial forward-looking climate \nscenario analysis in 2020 that focused on identifying and assessing the physical and transition climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities facing the company over the short, medium and long term. In 2022 and \nearly 2023, we continued to build on this by undertaking a more detailed analysis of these risks and \nopportunities. This included adding 1.5\u00b0C scenarios into our assessment, as well as expanding the number \nof sites included in the physical risk evaluation, exploring geographic regions around the world in which \nwe operate that are projected to experience greater impacts, and examining more closely the effects of \npotential changes in policy, technologies and markets.\nThe insights from this process, conducted in alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), continue to inform our climate strategy and are enabling us \nto more deeply integrate climate risk analysis into our ongoing risk management and business, strategy \nand financial planning processes.\nPhysical Risk Assessment \nWe conducted a climate risk screening in 2022 of approximately 400 American Airlines facilities and \nsuppliers, including airports, cargo facilities, data centers, maintenance facilities, jet fuel supplier plants, \noffices and training centers around the world. For each of these sites, we assessed the risk associated \nwith temperature, coastal flooding, fluvial (river) flooding, tropical cyclones (Eastern Atlantic basin only), \nwater stress, drought and wildfire.1 Our analysis was supported by The Climate Service, a leading provider \nof climate science and analytics for business. In early 2023, we supplemented that analysis by adding an \nassessment of physical risks under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. (See box at right for information on the scenarios.)\nThe results of our analysis refined our focus on 12 strategically important sites for our company, which \ninclude hub airports that form the foundation of our network; our largest maintenance facility; our \ncorporate headquarters, which is also home to our integrated operations center and primary training \nfacility; and a key fuel supplier. For each site, we modeled various scenarios to assess the exposure and \nimplications of the projected key physical hazards in the 2020s, 2030s and 2050s. Results from this \nanalysis were included in our 2022 Sustainability Report.\nWe have also gathered information on adaptive capacity \u2014 meaning the potential for resilience measures \nto manage climate-related impacts \u2014 for each of the locations, and we are engaging key stakeholders \nacross the company to discuss the identified risks and how we can better prepare our assets.\nTransition Risks and Opportunities Assessment\nWe continue to deepen and improve our analysis of American\u2019s exposure to transition risks related to \nclimate change, including the policy and legal, technology, market, reputation and operational risks \u2014 as \nwell as opportunities \u2014 that could arise from the transition to a low-carbon or carbon-constrained economy. \n1 Amer ican is reviewing the methodology for wildfire projections, which currently do not account for land use or \nland cover. References to wildfire risk are, therefore, omitted from this report.\nIn early 2023, we updated our transition risk and opportunity assessment using the latest available \nscenarios developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA): the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) \nand Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). Consistent with the ambition of the Paris Agreement, \nNZE sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to reach net zero emissions \nby 2050. We chose to use NZE for our analysis because it is a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, and also because it \nincludes aviation-specific narratives and milestones. (See box below for more information on the \nclimate scenarios we use for both our transition and physical risk assessments.)\nClimate Scenarios*\nScenario analysis is not a prediction or forecast of future events, but rather a tool to explore and \nhighlight central elements of possible futures. American uses multiple scenarios for our analysis. \nIn 2023, we updated our analysis to include 1.5\u00b0C scenarios for assessment of both physical and \ntransition risks. \nDue to the distinct nature of physical and transition risks, standard practice is to use different \nscenarios for analyzing the two different types of risks. For analysis of physical risk, we use \nRepresentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, as recommended by TCFD, which were \ndeveloped for use in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4980, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e30f7a7-bf52-4eca-8a78-1ea12b1fbd9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e30f7a7-bf52-4eca-8a78-1ea12b1fbd9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2e69fa2-972d-4e31-9f5b-fb7f299429af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "41d0d5c682576600afeed2147683725beb6fd9fbfe151ad5c5723c7084335b0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fa42183-f0ed-45d5-b1a0-5acf9ef6a64b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "1925d28183cd5e615e10bba82a92d33f281b2dd783aa4d4f3a8de1a13db7a352", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For analysis of \ntransition risk, we use the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook (WEO) STEPS and NZE scenarios.

The \n2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included the nation\u2019s first \nSAF-specific tax incentives, which took effect in 2023 and \nexpire in 2028.\nAmerican has SAF offtake agreements related to production \nfrom facilities that are planned but not yet operational, and \nwhich may use technology that has not been proven at \ncommercial scale. If the IRA credits are not extended or are \notherwise not sufficient in attracting significant investment \nin the SAF industry, we may not be able to source the \nvolume of SAF sufficient to meet our stated goals and on \nfavorable economic terms.\nGovernments also provide grant funding for SAF research \nand commercialization, and the reduction in cost needed to \nhelp the SAF market scale could slow if those policies are \nnot continued over time.\nPolicies at the state level in the U.S. have been important \nin reducing the cost premium for SAF over the cost of \nconventional jet fuel and have enabled American to \npurchased SAF for delivery, particularly in California. More \nstates are considering adoption of similar policies. If more \nstates do not adopt policies to encourage the delivery or \nproduction of SAF, the availability of and SAF may be too \nconstrained and the cost of SAF may be too high for us to \nmeet our stated goals.\nWe work individually and with a broad group of stakeholders to \nadvocate with policymakers at all levels of government to adopt \npolicies that will accelerate our industry\u2019s transition to lower-carbon \nalternative jet fuels. For example, at the federal level in 2023 and 2024, \nwe worked with stakeholders across several industries to create a new \ncoalition that is lobbying to enhance and extend the SAF-specific tax \nincentives in the IRA. American individually and in concert with Airlines \nfor America (A4A) also advocates for continued funding for federal \nresearch programs related to SAF.\nAt the state level, we work with policymakers to identify policy solutions \nthat can help scale decarbonization technologies for us and our industry. \nIn 2023, for example, we were successful in our work with government \nofficials and industry partners in Illinois in securing enactment of the \nstate\u2019s first SAF tax incentive \u2014 a significant development in a state \nwhere American has an important hub. We continue our work with \ncoalitions in other states to enact similar policies.\nAnd while policy support is vitally important to our industry\u2019s transition, \nwe recognize that private sector action must also play a role. As \nan anchor partner to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, American has \ncommitted to invest $100 million to advance a set of clean energy \ntechnologies \u2014 including SAF \u2014 that are critical to a zero-carbon \neconomy. This innovative collaborative effort is focused on helping these \ntechnologies access the capital they need to reach commercial scale. In \n2023, we entered into a firm, long-term offtake agreement with Infinium \nfor SAF from Project Roadrunner, Infinium\u2019s first-of-a-kind commercial-\nscale PtL eFuels facility.

For instance, on the basis of our 2023 offtake agreement with \nSAF producer Infinium, we are working to transfer the associated Scope 3 emissions \nreductions from the Infinium SAF to Citi, enabling it to reduce a portion of its Scope 3 \nGHG emissions associated with employee business travel.\nPotential Financial Opportunity Level\nLOW MED HIGH\n NZE\n STEPS\n70\nAmerican Airlines  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nREPORT 2023\nAbout American Airlines  \nand This Report\nIn Conversation With  \nAmerican\u2019s CEO\nSustainability Strategy \nAddressing Climate Change\nOperating Safely\nSupporting Our  \nTeam Members\nServing Our Customers\nSourcing Responsibly\nAppendix", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3246, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ddbaa13-5550-464a-93b6-c12e282e2684": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ddbaa13-5550-464a-93b6-c12e282e2684", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3d5b4cc-b151-49ff-ad81-09b91af8c837", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/hakantekgul/sample-apps/assurant-chatbot/data/AA - Sustainability 2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12315982, "creation_date": "2025-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-02"}, "hash": "f48c92f8a737e3e13327520169c5709a57c81829e49fbe850be5895110e5c7cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Financial Performance * 2023 2022 2021\nREVENUE\nPassenger  $48,512  $44,568  $26,063 \nCargo  812  1,233  1,314 \nOther  3,464  3,170  2,505 \nTotal operating revenue  52,788  48,971  29,882 \nTotal operating expenses  49,754  47,36 4  30,941 \nOperating income (loss)  3,034  1,607  (1,059)\nIncome tax provision (benefit)  299  59  (555)\nNet income (loss)  822  127  (1,993)\nBasic earnings (loss) per share  1.26  0.20  (3.09)\nCash dividends declared per common share \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n* In millions of U.S. dollars, except per-share amounts.\nOperational Performance 2023 2022 2021\nSASB Metrics\nMAINLINE\nRevenue passenger miles (millions)*  209,692  191,519  136,512 \nAvailable seat miles (millions)**  249,822  229,922  182,189 \nDepartures (thousands)  1,145  1,052  870 \nPassenger load factor (percent)*** 83.9% 83.3% 74.9%\nREGIONAL (INCLUDES CONTRACTED REGIONAL CARRIERS)\nRevenue passenger miles (millions)*  22,234  24,105  25,026 \nAvailable seat miles (millions)**  27,901  30,304  32,346 \nDepartures (thousands)  855  903  955 \nPassenger load factor*** 79.7% 79.5% 7 7.4%\nNote: American uses miles, rather than kilometers, for our operational data reporting in the SASB metrics.\n * Re venue passenger mile (RPM): A standard measure of passenger volume.

Boundary Description\nAmerican has presented jet fuel consumption intensity metrics, NOX emissions intensity \nmetrics and standardized energy consumption metrics from operations over which it has \nthe authority to introduce and implement its operating policies. Those operations include \nits mainline operating subsidiary and wholly owned regional subsidiaries.\nWater Withdrawn\nAmerican has presented water withdrawn as the volume of water withdrawn from municipal \nwater suppliers at American\u2019s facilities over which it has control to implement water \nconservation policies and for which American\u2019s volume of water withdrawn is available. This \nspecifically includes hangars, maintenance facilities, office buildings and the single terminal \nthat American operates in its entirety at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n4. Methodology\nIntensity Metrics for Jet Fuel Consumption\nJet fuel volume, which is supported by supplier invoices, is allocated between \npassengers and cargo based on the respective ratio of ton kilometers, as described in the \nInternational Air Transport Association\u2019s (IATA) Recommended Practice 1726: Passenger \nCO2 Calculation Methodology (IATA RP 1726). The calculation uses IATA\u2019s recommended \npassenger weight of 100 kilograms as the basis for passenger ton kilometers. Employee \ntravel and company cargo are considered non-revenue payload and are removed from the \nintensity calculations.\nIntensity Metrics for Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) Emissions from Jet Fuel Consumption \nAmerican calculates NOX mass using the ICAO Databank (June 2023), which includes \nfactors for NOX emissions during the landing/take-off cycle by engine type. A flight\u2019s \nlanding/take-off cycle includes all aircraft activity below 3,000 feet in elevation. Other \ndata points necessary to calculate NOX emissions, such as aircraft type and departures, \nare derived from internal data sources. \nTo calculate NOX intensities, American allocates NOX emissions between passengers and \ncargo based on the respective ratio of ton kilometers, as recommended in IATA RP 1726. \nThe calculation uses IATA\u2019s recommended passenger weight of 100 kilograms as the basis \nfor passenger ton kilometers. Employee travel and company cargo are considered non-\nrevenue payload and are removed from the intensity calculations.\nStandardized Energy Consumption\nThe energy density factor for jet fuel is from the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s Petroleum \nQuality Information System 2013 Annual Report, and the energy density factor for SAF is \nsourced from the results of a SAF sample tested by the supplier in 2023. All other energy \ndensity factors (e.g., diesel, gasoline, ethanol and renewable diesel) are sourced from \nthe lower heating values from the Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuels Data Center. \nFactors to convert British thermal units to megawatt hours are from the International \nEnergy Agency website.\nOther sources, including heating, cooling and steam consumed, are considered \nimmaterial and are excluded.\nWater Withdrawn\nThe volume of water withdrawn is based on the U.S. definition of gallons.\n5. Use of estimates and estimation uncertainties \nAmerican bases its estimates and methodologies on historical performance, available \ninformation and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable.
